0,neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of the customer review that says, ""Person on duty was P. Garippa."" I'm not very experienced with sentiment analysis, so I'll have to think this through step by step.

First, I'll read the review again to make sure I understand it. It just mentions that the person on duty was P. Garippa. There's no explicit positive or negative language here. It's a straightforward statement without any adjectives or emotional words. 

I know that sentiment analysis often looks for words that indicate feelings, like ""excellent,"" ""terrible,"" or ""satisfied."" In this case, there are none. The review is more of an observation rather than an opinion. It doesn't express whether the customer was happy, upset, or indifferent.

Maybe the name P. Garippa is significant? Perhaps if I knew something about P. Garippa, like if they're known for good service, it might affect the sentiment. But without that context, I can't assume anything. The review doesn't provide any clues about the quality of service or the customer's experience.

So, considering all this, the sentiment is neither positive nor negative. It's just a neutral statement of fact.
</think>

Neutral",Person on duty was P. Garippa.
1,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""After all hubby and I are married!"" The options are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Let me break this down.

First, the review is pretty short, just one sentence. The key words here are ""After all"" and ""married."" ""After all"" can sometimes indicate that something was unexpected or that there was a prior doubt, but in this context, it's followed by a positive statement about being married. 

""Hubby"" is a term of endearment, which is positive. The exclamation mark at the end adds a sense of excitement or emphasis. So, putting it together, the customer seems happy about their marriage. 

I don't see any negative words or context here. The exclamation mark suggests a positive emotion. Even though ""after all"" might sometimes be used in negative contexts, in this case, it seems to highlight that despite any prior circumstances, the marriage has happened, which is a positive outcome.

So, considering all this, the sentiment is Positive.
</think>

Positive",After all hubby and I are married!
2,positive,"Okay, so I need to classify the sentiment of this customer review as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The review says, ""I then want to 24 hour fitness and registered with no issues."" Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the customer mentions wanting to go to 24 Hour Fitness. That's a positive action because they're expressing a desire to use the service. Then they say they registered with no issues. Registering without any problems is a good experience, which usually indicates satisfaction.

I don't see any negative words here. The phrase ""no issues"" is definitely a positive point. There's no complaint or dissatisfaction mentioned. The overall tone seems positive because the customer was able to complete their registration smoothly.

I don't think it's Neutral because the customer is actively expressing a positive experience. There's no ambiguity or mixed feelings. So, I'm leaning towards Positive.

Wait, could there be any hidden negatives? Maybe if they had trouble finding the gym or the staff wasn't helpful, but the review doesn't mention that. It's all about wanting to go and registering without issues. So yeah, Positive makes sense here.
</think>

Positive",I then want to 24 hour fitness and registered with no issues.
3,positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of this customer review: ""They stayed 30 mins after closing time just to help another man out."" Hmm, let's break it down. The customer is talking about a business that went above and beyond their usual hours to assist someone. Staying 30 minutes extra isn't a huge time commitment, but it shows willingness to help. The phrase ""just to help another man out"" emphasizes that the staff didn't mind extending their time to provide assistance. This kind of action is usually seen as positive because it reflects good customer service and a helpful attitude. The customer seems appreciative of this gesture, so the sentiment is likely positive. There's no negative language here, and it's not neutral because the action is clearly commendable. So, I think the sentiment is Positive.
</think>

Positive",They stayed 30 mins after closing time just to help another man out.
4,neutral,"Alright, let's analyze this customer review: ""Here from Upstate NY and we're looking for something good on our last night here."" The user is a business owner seeking sentiment classification. The review doesn't express a clear positive or negative emotion. The customer is stating their situation without indicating satisfaction or dissatisfaction. They're just mentioning they're looking for something good, which is neutral. So, the sentiment is Neutral.
</think>

Neutral",Here from Upstate NY and we're looking for something good on our last night here.
5,negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""this is what it has all come to ."". The options are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Let me break this down.

First, I'll look at the words used. The phrase starts with ""this is what it has all come to."" That sounds a bit dramatic, maybe indicating some strong emotion. The word ""come to"" often implies a culmination of events or a final state, which can sometimes be negative if the context suggests disappointment or frustration.

There's no explicit positive language here, like ""excellent"" or ""satisfied."" Instead, the phrasing feels more reflective or perhaps critical. The customer might be expressing dissatisfaction or a sense of decline, which would lean towards a negative sentiment.

Also, the sentence ends with a period, not an exclamation mark, so it's not overly enthusiastic. The overall tone doesn't seem positive or neutral; it feels more like a complaint or a lament.

So, considering all that, the sentiment is likely Negative.
</think>

Negative",this is what it has all come to .
6,positive,"Alright, let's see. I need to classify the sentiment of the customer review: ""loved our visit and will certainly be going back!"" The options are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. 

First, I'll break down the sentence. The word ""loved"" is a strong positive verb, indicating a favorable experience. Then, ""our visit"" is neutral on its own, but combined with ""loved,"" it becomes positive. The second part says they ""will certainly be going back,"" which shows intention to return, a sign of satisfaction. 

There's no negative language here. Words like ""loved"" and ""certainly be going back"" are clear indicators of a positive sentiment. The exclamation mark at the end adds enthusiasm, reinforcing the positive tone. 

I don't see any neutral elements that would make this a middle-of-the-road sentiment. It's clearly expressing satisfaction and a desire to return, which are strong positive indicators. 

So, putting it all together, the sentiment is definitely Positive.
</think>

Positive",loved our visit and will certainly be going back!
7,neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of this customer review. The review says, ""Went to a BMW dealership and a salesperson came out within a few minutes and we were test driving a 320i soon after."" 

First, I'll break down the key points. The customer visited a BMW dealership, which is a positive action since they're interested in the product. The salesperson came out quickly, which indicates good service and responsiveness. Then, they were able to test drive a 320i soon after, showing that the process was efficient and smooth.

I don't see any negative words or phrases here. The customer didn't mention any issues or dissatisfaction. Instead, the focus is on the quick service and the ability to test drive a car, which are positive experiences. The tone seems neutral, but the actions described lean towards a positive experience because the customer was able to move through the process without delays.

However, the customer didn't explicitly state whether they liked the car or the service beyond the efficiency. So, while the experience was good, there's no strong positive emotion expressed. Therefore, the sentiment is likely Neutral because it's more about the facts without a clear positive or negative opinion.
</think>

Neutral",Went to a BMW dealership and a salesperson came out within a few minutes and we were test driving a 320i soon after.
8,negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the review ""I regret not going for the large !!"" The business owner wants to classify it as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Let me break this down.

First, the phrase starts with ""I regret not going for the large."" The word ""regret"" usually has a negative connotation. It implies that the person feels sorry about a decision they made. In this case, they didn't choose the large size, and now they're regretting it.

The exclamation marks at the end might indicate strong emotion. Since it's a regret, that emotion is likely negative. They might have felt that the large size would have been better, and not getting it made them unhappy.

Is there any positive aspect here? Well, maybe they enjoyed whatever they did get, but the focus is on the regret. The main sentiment is about missing out on something bigger, which is a negative feeling.

So putting it all together, the sentiment is Negative because of the regret expressed.
</think>

Negative",I regret not going for the large !!
9,positive,"Alright, I'm looking at this customer review: ""The place has an old skool barbershop feel with sports playing on the TV."" The user wants me to classify the sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. 

First, I'll break down the review. The customer is describing the atmosphere of the place. They mention an ""old skool barbershop feel,"" which gives a nostalgic vibe, often seen as positive. Then they add that there's sports playing on the TV. This suggests a lively or enjoyable environment, especially for sports fans.

I need to determine if these are positive indicators. The terms used are neutral in themselves, but the overall tone seems positive. The customer is highlighting features that contribute to a pleasant experience without explicitly stating if they're happy or not. However, the mention of a cozy, familiar atmosphere and entertainment usually implies satisfaction.

I should consider if there's any negative connotation here. The words don't indicate dissatisfaction or complaints. It's more about the ambiance and what's available, which are positive aspects for a barbershop.

So, putting it all together, the sentiment leans towards Positive because the customer is describing a welcoming and entertaining environment, which are favorable attributes.
</think>

Positive",The place has an old skool barbershop feel with sports playing on the TV.
10,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of this customer review. Let me read it again: ""Plastic still on the seats, 25km on the odometer, all the promised options and that awesome new truck smell."" Hmm, let's break it down.

First, ""Plastic still on the seats."" I think that's a good sign because when you buy a new car, having the plastic on the seats is normal. It means the car is new and hasn't been used much, right? So that's positive.

Next, ""25km on the odometer."" That's a very low mileage, which is great. It indicates the vehicle is almost brand new, so that's another positive point.

Then, ""all the promised options."" This suggests that the customer received everything they were supposed to get. They didn't miss out on any features, which is definitely a positive aspect.

Lastly, ""that awesome new truck smell."" The smell of a new car is something people often associate with quality and freshness, so this is another positive comment.

Putting it all together, all the points in the review are positive. The customer is happy with the newness of the truck, the included features, and the pleasant smell. There's nothing negative mentioned here. So the sentiment should be Positive.
</think>

Positive","Plastic still on the seats, 25km on the odometer, all the promised options and that awesome new truck smell."
11,positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of this customer review. The review says, ""Since it was our first time there, we didn't know what to order and but the server was super helpful and recommended a lot of dishes. I loved it."" 

First, I'll break it down. The customer mentions it was their first time, so they were unsure about what to order. That part is neutral because it's just stating a fact. But then they talk about the server being ""super helpful"" and recommending dishes, which are positive words. The server's assistance made their experience better. 

The last sentence is a strong indicator: ""I loved it."" That's a clear positive sentiment. Even though they started by saying they didn't know what to order, the server's help turned that into a positive experience. There's no negative language here; everything points towards satisfaction.

So, putting it all together, the sentiment is definitely positive because the customer had a good experience thanks to the helpful server and ended with a positive statement.
</think>

Positive","Since it was our first time there, we didn't know what to order and but the server was super helpful and recommended a lot of dishes. I loved it."
12,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""So, take home message!!..."" The user is asking me to classify it as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the words used. The phrase starts with ""So,"" which is pretty neutral—it's just a conversational starter. Then it says ""take home message!!..."" The word ""message"" is neutral on its own, but the double exclamation marks might indicate some emphasis. However, without the actual message content, it's hard to tell if it's positive or negative.

The ellipsis at the end suggests that the sentence is incomplete or that the thought is trailing off. This makes it even harder to gauge the sentiment because we don't have the full context. The customer could be trying to make a point, but without knowing what that point is, I can't determine if it's positive or negative.

I should consider common scenarios. If someone says ""take home message,"" they might be summarizing their experience. But without knowing what the message is, it's impossible to assign a sentiment. It could be a positive takeaway, like ""Everything was great!"" or a negative one, like ""Don't recommend this place."" But since we don't know, we can't assume.

Also, the use of exclamation marks could indicate excitement, which might lean towards positive, but it's not definitive. They could be excited about a good or a bad experience. Without more context, it's safer to go with Neutral.

I think the key here is that the review is too vague. It doesn't provide enough information to determine if the sentiment is positive or negative. Therefore, the most accurate classification is Neutral.
</think>

Neutral","So, take home message!!..."
13,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the customer review ""Formuliac, but fun."" Hmm, let's break it down. The review is short, so each word probably carries some weight. 

First, ""Formuliac"" – I'm not sure if that's a typo or a real word. Maybe it's supposed to be ""formulaic""? If that's the case, formulaic usually has a negative connotation, implying something is predictable or lacks originality. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a brand name or a specific term, but I don't recognize it. 

Next, the word ""but"" is a conjunction that often signals a contrast. So whatever comes after might counterbalance the first part. Then we have ""fun,"" which is clearly positive. Fun suggests enjoyment or entertainment, so that's a positive sentiment.

So putting it together: If ""Formuliac"" is negative (assuming it's a typo for formulaic), then the review is saying something is formulaic but still fun. The negative aspect is balanced by the positive. Alternatively, if ""Formuliac"" isn't negative, then the sentiment might be mixed or neutral. 

But since the user is asking for one label among Positive, Negative, or Neutral, I have to choose. The presence of ""fun"" is a strong positive indicator. Even if the first part is negative, the overall sentiment might lean towards positive because the reviewer found it fun despite being formulaic. 

Wait, but the instruction says to choose exactly one label. If the positive aspect is stronger, maybe it's Positive. However, sometimes when people use ""but,"" they're downplaying the positive with a negative. For example, ""It's fun but formulaic."" In that case, the sentiment might be more neutral because there's both positive and negative elements.

But without more context, it's tricky. The word ""fun"" is quite positive, so maybe the overall sentiment is Positive. Or perhaps Neutral because there's a mix. I'm a bit confused. 

Wait, the user is an expert sentiment analyst, so maybe they consider the positive word as the dominant sentiment. Alternatively, maybe the negative aspect makes it Neutral. I think I'll go with Neutral because it's a mixed sentiment with both positive and negative elements.
</think>

Neutral","Formuliac , but fun ."
14,neutral,"Alright, let me try to figure out the sentiment of this review. The customer wrote, ""And for contrast I alternated between bites of the cookies and scoops of the pot-de-cream."" Hmm, at first glance, it seems like they're describing their experience of eating cookies and pot-de-cream together. 

I'm thinking about the words used here. They mention alternating between bites of cookies and scoops of the dessert. The word ""contrast"" might imply that they're comparing the two items. But does that mean they liked both, or is there a negative connotation?

The phrase doesn't express any clear positive or negative emotions. There's no use of words like ""delicious,"" ""amazing,"" ""disappointing,"" or ""terrible."" It's more of a neutral observation about their eating experience. They're just stating what they did without giving a clear opinion on the quality or taste of the items.

So, considering all that, I think the sentiment here is Neutral. They're not expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction; they're just sharing an action they took.
</think>

Neutral",And for contrast I alternated between bites of the cookies and scoops of the pot-de-cream.
15,neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""We made a reservation beforehand so we were expected."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the content of the review. The customer mentions making a reservation beforehand, which is a proactive step. That usually indicates some level of planning and anticipation. They also say that they were ""expected,"" which could mean that the staff were prepared for their arrival. 

Now, considering the sentiment labels: Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The statement doesn't express any strong emotion. There's no use of words like ""great,"" ""amazing,"" or ""terrible."" Instead, it's a factual statement about their experience. 

I'm thinking about whether ""expected"" has a positive connotation here. In some contexts, being expected can mean that the service was smooth, which is good. But without more context, it's hard to tell if the customer is happy about it or just stating a fact. 

Since there's no explicit positive or negative language, the sentiment is likely Neutral. The customer isn't expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction, just a neutral observation about their reservation experience.
</think>

Neutral",We made a reservation beforehand so we were expected.
16,positive,"Okay, so I need to classify the sentiment of the customer review ""The dog parties are the best."" into Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I'll read the review again: ""The dog parties are the best."" The customer is talking about dog parties, which I assume are events where people bring their dogs to socialize or have fun. The phrase ""are the best"" is clearly a strong positive statement. ""Best"" is a superlative, indicating that the speaker holds this event in high regard compared to others.

Next, I'll consider the context. Dog parties aren't inherently positive or negative; it's the customer's experience that matters. The use of ""best"" suggests satisfaction and a positive experience. There's no negative language here, so it's not negative. It's also not neutral because the customer is expressing a strong opinion, not just stating a fact.

I should also think about possible nuances. Could ""best"" be sarcastic? The sentence doesn't provide any cues for sarcasm, like irony or a contradictory statement. It's straightforward and positive. Additionally, the exclamation could have been used, but even without it, the word ""best"" conveys enthusiasm.

Another angle is the subject matter. Dog parties might be a niche event, but the sentiment expressed is unambiguously positive. The customer is likely happy with the event, perhaps the organization, the activities, or the overall experience.

I don't see any neutral elements here. The customer is clearly expressing a positive opinion. So, the sentiment should be classified as Positive.
</think>

Positive",The dog parties are the best.
17,negative,"Okay, I need to classify the sentiment of this customer review. The review says, ""I went in with a cold/allergies and a swollen icky eye."" Let me break this down.

First, the customer mentions having a cold and allergies, which are both uncomfortable conditions. They also describe having a ""swollen icky eye,"" which sounds unpleasant. The use of the word ""icky"" adds a negative connotation, indicating discomfort or dissatisfaction.

There's no positive language here, just a description of health issues. The overall tone doesn't express satisfaction or a positive experience. Instead, it conveys the customer's discomfort and possibly frustration with their situation.

So, considering the negative descriptors and the absence of positive words, the sentiment here is Negative.
</think>

Negative",I went in with a cold/allergies and a swollen icky eye.
18,negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of this customer review. The review says, ""I was having second thoughts about ordering the plate because I'm not a fan of rice or beans."" 

First, I notice that the customer mentions having ""second thoughts"" about ordering. That usually indicates some hesitation or uncertainty. They're not outright saying they're unhappy, but they're considering not making the purchase. 

Next, the reason given is that they're ""not a fan of rice or beans."" This suggests that the menu items didn't appeal to them. Disliking the food options is a negative point because it shows the customer isn't satisfied with what's available.

Putting it together, the customer is expressing dissatisfaction with the menu, which leads them to reconsider their order. While they haven't explicitly stated that they had a bad experience, their hesitation and dislike of the food items lean towards a negative sentiment. They might not be outright negative, but their reluctance is a sign of dissatisfaction.

So, considering all this, the sentiment is Negative.
</think>

Negative",I was having second thoughts about ordering the plate because im not a fan of rice or beans.
19,neutral,"Okay, so I need to determine the sentiment of the review: ""Eventually we were on our way to the hotels."" The options are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Let me break this down.

First, looking at the words used. The key word here is ""Eventually."" That often implies that something took longer than expected or wasn't straightforward. It might suggest some frustration or delay. 

The rest of the sentence is about being on the way to the hotels, which sounds neutral on its own. But combined with ""eventually,"" it might hint at a slight inconvenience. However, the overall tone doesn't express strong positive or negative emotions. There's no explicit praise or complaint, just a statement of fact with a slight implication of waiting.

So, considering the options, it's not clearly positive or negative. It leans a bit towards negative because of ""eventually,"" but not strongly enough. It's more of a neutral statement with a minor negative undertone. But since the sentiment labels are strictly Positive, Negative, or Neutral, and the main sentiment isn't overtly negative, I think it's best classified as Neutral.
</think>

Neutral",Eventually we were on our way to the hotels.
20,positive,"Okay, so I need to determine the sentiment of the customer review: ""Came here about 4 months ago and I was very impressed."" The options are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. 

First, I'll break down the review. The customer mentions coming to the place about four months ago, which is a specific timeframe. The key part here is ""I was very impressed."" The word ""impressed"" generally has a positive connotation. It suggests that the customer had a favorable experience. 

There's no negative language used, and the exclamation of being ""very impressed"" emphasizes a strong positive feeling. The review doesn't express any dissatisfaction or neutral feelings; it's clearly highlighting a positive experience. 

I should also consider the structure of the sentence. It's a straightforward statement without any sarcasm or hidden meanings that might indicate a different sentiment. The customer is sharing a past experience but the sentiment expressed is still positive.

Therefore, the sentiment here is Positive.
</think>

Positive",Came here about 4 months ago and i  was very impressed.
21,negative,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""It's cash only?"" The user has asked me to classify it as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the review is a question: ""It's cash only?"" This indicates that the customer is asking if the business only accepts cash. The phrasing is neutral on its own, but the context might imply something else. Maybe the customer prefers using a card and is surprised or inconvenienced by the cash-only policy. 

If the customer is unhappy about not being able to use a card, the sentiment might be Negative. However, if they're just seeking information without expressing a negative emotion, it could be Neutral. The question mark suggests uncertainty or surprise, which could lean towards a negative sentiment if the customer feels inconvenienced. But without explicit negative words, it's a bit tricky.

I think the sentiment is Negative because the customer's surprise or inconvenience about the cash-only policy likely reflects dissatisfaction. However, it's a bit ambiguous, so Neutral is also a possibility. But leaning towards Negative because the question implies a potential issue.
</think>

Negative",It's cash only?
22,negative,"Alright, I need to classify the sentiment of this customer review as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The review says, ""I have had a lot of negative experiences with dentists because of difficulty being numbed."" 

First, I'll break down the key words. The phrase ""negative experiences"" is a strong indicator of dissatisfaction. The customer is explicitly stating they've had many bad experiences, which points towards a negative sentiment. 

Next, the reason given is ""difficulty being numbed."" This likely refers to the numbing process not working effectively, causing discomfort or pain during dental procedures. Such an issue would naturally lead to a negative experience for the customer.

There's no positive language here, and the overall tone is clearly expressing frustration and past unpleasantness. Therefore, the sentiment conveyed in this review is Negative.
</think>

Negative",I have had a lot of negative experiences with dentists because of difficulty being numbed.
23,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""Oh, you can get a bud or bud light for HH."" First, I should break down the sentence to understand what's being said. The phrase starts with ""Oh,"" which could indicate surprise or excitement, but it's not necessarily positive or negative on its own. The main part is ""you can get a bud or bud light for HH."" 

I know that ""bud"" and ""bud light"" are brands of beer, so the customer is talking about availability. They're pointing out that these specific beers are available at the establishment, referred to here as ""HH."" The sentiment here seems to be neutral because the customer is simply stating a fact about product availability. There's no explicit positive or negative language. They're not complaining or complimenting; they're just informing.

I should consider if there's any implied sentiment. Maybe the customer is suggesting that having these beers is a good thing, but without more context, it's hard to tell. They could be neutral, positive, or even negative depending on the situation. However, since the statement is factual without any emotional words, it's safest to classify it as Neutral.
</think>

Neutral","Oh, you can get a bud or bud light for HH."
24,negative,"Alright, I need to classify the sentiment of the customer review: ""The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma."" The options are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. 

First, I'll break down the review. The customer is talking about lead actors, so it's about a performance or a show. They mention that the actors share ""no chemistry."" Chemistry between actors usually refers to how well they interact and connect, which is important for engaging the audience. If there's no chemistry, it suggests the interaction was unconvincing or lacking.

Next, the review also says the actors have ""no... engaging charisma."" Charisma is about how compelling or magnetic an actor is. If they're not engaging, it means the audience might find them boring or not captivating.

Putting it together, the review is pointing out two significant shortcomings: lack of chemistry and lack of charisma. Both are negative aspects that would likely make the viewing experience unsatisfying. So, the sentiment here is negative because the customer is expressing dissatisfaction with the actors' performance.

I don't think it's neutral because the review isn't just stating a fact without emotion; it's clearly critical. It's also not positive since there's no praise or positive sentiment expressed. Therefore, the sentiment is Negative.
</think>

Negative",The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
25,negative,"Alright, so I need to determine the sentiment of the customer review: ""i am in my own thoughts but i faced lots of problem."" The options are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. 

First, I'll break down the review. The customer starts by saying they're ""in my own thoughts."" That could mean they're deep in thought or maybe a bit distracted. It's a bit ambiguous, so I'm not sure if that's positive or negative on its own. 

Then, the second part says, ""but i faced lots of problem."" The word ""faced"" here suggests they encountered issues, and ""lots of problem"" indicates multiple problems. That sounds negative. The use of ""but"" also contrasts the first part, which might have been more neutral or positive, but the problems make the overall sentiment negative.

So, putting it together, despite the initial part, the mention of facing many problems leans the sentiment towards negative.
</think>

Negative",i am in my own thoughts but i faced lots of problem
26,positive,"Alright, so I need to determine the sentiment of this customer review. The review says, ""You can drive through in that amount of time but I would recommend 2 hours if you want to stop and soak in the views and 3 or 4 hours (minimum) if you want to enjoy a nice hike and take in a lifetime experience."" 

First, I'll break it down. The customer mentions that driving through is possible in a certain time, but they are suggesting longer times for different activities. They recommend 2 hours for stopping and enjoying the views, and 3-4 hours for a hike and a lifetime experience. 

The language used here is positive. Words like ""recommend,"" ""soak in the views,"" ""enjoy a nice hike,"" and ""lifetime experience"" all convey a positive sentiment. The customer is providing helpful advice, indicating that they had a good experience and want others to have the same by allocating enough time.

There's no negative language here. The mention of driving through quickly doesn't seem to express dissatisfaction; instead, it's setting a baseline and then encouraging more time for a better experience. So overall, the sentiment is positive because the customer is sharing a favorable experience and tips to enhance others' visits.
</think>

Positive",You can drive through in that amount of time but I would recommend 2 hours of you want to stop and soak in the views and 3 or 4 hours (minimum) if you want to enjoy a nice hike and take in a lifetime experience.
27,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""Our server had picked the wine for the menu, we picked it for the meal."" Hmm, let's break this down. 

First, the sentence is a bit confusing. It says the server picked the wine for the menu, but the customer picked it for the meal. Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe the server chose a wine that didn't match the meal, and the customer had to correct that? Or perhaps the server did a good job by selecting a wine that complemented the meal? 

I'm not entirely sure. The wording is a bit unclear. The phrase ""picked the wine for the menu"" could mean the server selected a wine that goes well with the menu items. Then, the customer says they picked it for the meal, which might imply that they were satisfied because the wine matched the meal. But it's a bit ambiguous. 

Alternatively, maybe the server's choice was for the menu, but the customer's choice was for the meal, which could mean the server didn't consider the meal when selecting the wine. That might be a negative point because the customer had to adjust it. 

I'm leaning towards Neutral because the statement doesn't clearly express satisfaction or dissatisfaction. It's more of a factual statement without strong positive or negative language. There's no explicit praise or criticism, just a description of actions. So, the sentiment is likely Neutral.
</think>

Neutral","Our server had picked the wine for the menu, we picked it for the meal."
28,neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""My wife and I spent $46 dollar tonight."" The possible labels are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. 

First, I'll read the sentence carefully. The customer mentions spending $46, but they don't express any emotion or opinion about the experience. There's no word of approval like ""great"" or ""excellent,"" nor is there any dissatisfaction like ""terrible"" or ""bad."" It's just a statement of fact about the amount spent.

I should consider if the amount spent can imply anything. $46 isn't inherently positive or negative without context. For some, it might be a reasonable amount, while others might think it's expensive. But since the customer doesn't provide any feelings or judgments, it's neutral.

Also, the sentence structure is straightforward and factual. There's no sarcasm or hidden meaning that I can detect. The customer is simply sharing information about their expenditure without giving any clues about their satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

So, putting it all together, the sentiment is neither positive nor negative. It's just a neutral statement of what happened.
</think>

Neutral",My wife and I spent $46 dollar tonight.
29,negative,"Okay, I need to classify the sentiment of this customer review as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The review says: ""She then tried to argue with me that his meal didn't come with those things until the other server corrected her. very unprofessional.""

First, I'll break down the content. The customer is describing an interaction where a server argued with them about the meal's contents. The argument continued until another server corrected the first one. The customer ends by calling the behavior ""very unprofessional.""

The key points here are the argumentative behavior and the use of the term ""unprofessional."" Both of these indicate dissatisfaction and a negative experience. The customer is expressing frustration with the service quality, which points towards a Negative sentiment.

I don't see any positive aspects mentioned; the focus is entirely on the negative interaction. There's no neutral language here—words like ""argued"" and ""unprofessional"" are strong indicators of a Negative sentiment.
</think>

Negative",She then tried to argue with me that his meal didn't come with those things until the other server corrected her. very unprofessional
30,negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""I have to wait 15 minutes, while the people yesterday waited 30 minutes."" Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the customer is talking about waiting times. They mention waiting 15 minutes, which is shorter than the 30 minutes others waited the day before. On the surface, it seems like they're comparing their experience favorably to others. So, does that mean they're happy?

Wait, but the way they phrase it might matter. They say ""I have to wait 15 minutes,"" which sounds a bit negative because waiting is generally not a positive experience. However, they also mention that others waited longer, which could imply that they're slightly relieved or happier because their wait time was shorter.

But sentiment analysis isn't just about the comparison; it's about the overall feeling. The customer is pointing out that they had a better experience than others, but the fact that they had to wait at all might still carry a negative connotation. They might be expressing that the service is slow, even if it's an improvement from the previous day.

Alternatively, maybe they're just stating a fact without a strong emotion. But given that they're comparing their wait time to others, it's more likely they're expressing some level of dissatisfaction, albeit less than the previous day. So, the sentiment here might be negative because waiting is an inconvenience, even if it's shorter.

Wait, but could it be neutral? They're not explicitly saying they're happy or upset, just stating a fact. But the use of ""have to wait"" might indicate a slight negative sentiment. I think it leans more towards negative because waiting, even for a shorter time, can be frustrating.

So, putting it all together, the sentiment is probably Negative.
</think>

Negative","I have to wait 15 minutes, while the people yesterday waited 30 minutes."
31,negative,"Alright, so I need to figure out the sentiment of this customer review: ""I lived at Autumn Park for a year my senior year in college and I don't miss it one bit."" The options are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. 

First, I'll break down the sentence. The person stayed at Autumn Park for a year during their senior year. They mention that they don't miss it at all. The phrase ""don't miss it one bit"" is a strong indicator here. It suggests dissatisfaction or unhappiness with their experience. 

I should consider the context. If someone doesn't miss a place where they lived, especially after a year, it usually means they had a negative experience. They probably didn't enjoy living there, which could be due to various factors like poor service, uncomfortable living conditions, or other issues. 

There's no positive language here. Words like ""great,"" ""enjoyed,"" or ""loved"" are missing. Instead, the emphasis is on not missing it, which leans towards a negative sentiment. 

I don't think it's Neutral because the statement clearly expresses a sentiment. Neutral would be something like ""It was okay"" or ""No complaints."" But here, the customer is actively stating they don't miss it, which is a negative sentiment.

So, putting it all together, the sentiment is Negative.
</think>

Negative",I lived at Autumn Park for a year my senior year in college and I don't miss it one bit.
32,negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of this customer review. Let me read it again: ""Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool, but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up."" 

Hmm, the review starts by mentioning ""flashy gadgets"" and ""whirling fight sequences,"" which sounds positive because those things are often seen as exciting or impressive. The word ""cool"" also adds a positive vibe. But then there's a ""but"" which usually indicates a shift in sentiment. The second part talks about these elements not being able to distract from the ""flawed support structure."" The word ""flawed"" is definitely negative, and ""can't distract"" suggests that despite the positives, the negatives are more significant.

So, putting it all together, the reviewer is pointing out that while there are some cool aspects, the overall structure is weak. This makes the sentiment more negative because the flaws are the main takeaway. The positives are just there to contrast with the negatives, but the negative part is the focus.
</think>

Negative","Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up ."
33,positive,"Okay, I need to classify the sentiment of this customer review: ""I had one of their white pizzas. It was delicious."" The options are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. 

First, I'll read the review carefully. The customer mentions having a white pizza and then states that it was delicious. The word ""delicious"" is a strong positive adjective, indicating satisfaction. There's no negative language or neutral statements here. The overall tone is clearly happy and approving. 

So, putting it all together, the sentiment expressed here is definitely positive.
</think>

Positive",I had one of their white pizzas. It was delicious.
34,neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""I don't think any one item costs $5 or more."" The options are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Let's break this down.

First, the statement is about the pricing of items. The customer is saying that they don't believe any item costs $5 or more. On the surface, that could mean a few things. It might indicate that the customer is surprised that items are priced lower than expected, which could be positive if they were expecting higher prices. Alternatively, it might suggest that the customer feels the items are overpriced, which would be negative.

I need to consider the context. If this is a review for a store or service, the customer's sentiment could be based on their expectations. If they were expecting higher prices and found them lower, that's positive. But if they thought the items should be more expensive, that might be negative.

The phrase ""I don't think"" suggests some uncertainty, but it's more about the customer's belief. Without additional context, it's hard to gauge the emotion. There's no explicit positive or negative language here. The statement is more of a factual assertion rather than an opinion with emotion.

Therefore, the sentiment is likely Neutral because the customer is making a statement without expressing a clear positive or negative emotion.
</think>

Neutral",I don't think any one item costs $5 or more.
35,positive,"Okay, so I need to classify the sentiment of the customer review ""Do yourself a favor and try some new beers."" The options are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Let me think about this step by step.

First, the review is suggesting that someone should try new beers. The phrase ""do yourself a favor"" is often used in a positive way, implying that the action will be beneficial or enjoyable. It's like a recommendation, which usually has a positive connotation.

The word ""try"" here is neutral on its own, but combined with the context of suggesting new beers, it seems encouraging. There's no negative language used, so it's notNegative. It's not just stating a fact either, so it's more than Neutral.

So putting it all together, the sentiment is Positive because the reviewer is encouraging others to try new beers, which is a positive suggestion.
</think>

Positive",Do yourself a favor and try some new beers.
36,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""And it's not as busy currently."" Alright, let's break this down. The customer is talking about the current state of a place, specifically mentioning that it's not as busy. Now, when a customer says a place isn't busy, what does that usually mean? Well, in many cases, a busy place can sometimes be seen as a good thing because it might indicate popularity or a good product. However, if the customer is pointing out that it's not busy, they might be implying that it's less crowded than expected or perhaps less popular, which could be a negative point.

But wait, is there any positive spin here? Maybe the customer prefers a less busy environment. If they find it less crowded, that could mean it's easier to get service or enjoy the place without the hustle and bustle. But the way it's phrased here is a bit neutral. The customer is just stating a fact without expressing a strong positive or negative emotion.

So, considering all that, the sentiment doesn't seem to lean heavily in either the positive or negative direction. It's more of an observation without a clear emotional charge. Therefore, the sentiment is likely Neutral.
</think>

Neutral",And it's not as busy currently.
37,positive,"Okay, I need to classify the sentiment of the customer review ""OK, perfect!"" into one of the three categories: Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the words used. The review starts with ""OK,"" which is a neutral response. It's neither clearly positive nor negative on its own. However, the second part is ""perfect!"" The word ""perfect"" is strongly positive, indicating satisfaction or excellence.

I should consider the overall tone. Even though ""OK"" is neutral, the exclamation mark after ""perfect"" adds emphasis, showing strong approval. The combination of a neutral word followed by a very positive one leans the sentiment towards positive. 

Additionally, in many cases, when a customer uses ""perfect,"" it's a clear indicator of a positive experience. The exclamation mark also conveys enthusiasm, which is typically associated with positive sentiment.

Therefore, despite the initial neutral word, the dominant sentiment here is positive due to the strong positive adjective and the enthusiastic punctuation.
</think>

Positive","OK, perfect!"
38,negative,"Okay, so I need to determine the sentiment of the customer review: ""I take my heels in for repair when the taps of my heel wear down."" Hmm, let's break this down. The customer is talking about taking their heels in for repair. That suggests they're having an issue with their product—the taps wearing down. Now, is this a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment?

Well, the fact that they're bringing them in for repair indicates that there's a problem. The taps wearing down is a negative aspect because it means the product isn't lasting as long as expected. However, the customer is taking action by getting them repaired, which might show some level of satisfaction with the repair service. But the main issue is about the product wearing down, which is a flaw.

So, the sentiment here is likely negative because the customer is pointing out a flaw in the product. Even though they're using the repair service, the primary focus is on the problem with the heels. Therefore, the sentiment is Negative.
</think>

Negative",I take my heels in for repair when the taps of my heel wear down.
39,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of this customer review: ""I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice."" The options are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. 

First, I'll read the review again. It says the person tried their wife's dish, which was Spicy Pork with white rice. There's no explicit positive or negative language here. They're just stating what they tried. 

I don't see any adjectives like ""delicious"" or ""terrible,"" so there's no clear indication of sentiment. It's more of a factual statement about what they ate. 

Since there's no emotional language or opinion, I think the sentiment is Neutral. They didn't express satisfaction or dissatisfaction, just described the experience.
</think>

Neutral",I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice.
40,neutral,"Okay, so I need to determine the sentiment of this customer review. The review says, ""Arrived, noticed the place was kinda cheaply decorated, but whatever, not there for decorations."" 

First, I'll break it down. The customer mentions that the place was ""kinda cheaply decorated."" The word ""cheaply"" can have a negative connotation, implying that the decor wasn't up to their expectations or standards. However, they immediately follow that with ""but whatever,"" which often indicates dismissal or indifference. Then they clarify, ""not there for decorations,"" suggesting that the main purpose of their visit wasn't about the ambiance or looks, so the decoration issue isn't a big deal to them.

So, the negative aspect is present, but it's quickly downplayed. The overall tone doesn't seem overly positive either because they did notice something they didn't like. But since they're dismissing it and not focused on that aspect, it doesn't lean strongly negative. It's more of a neutral sentiment because they're not expressing a strong positive or negative emotion. They're just stating a fact and then moving past it.
</think>

Neutral","Arrived, noticed the place was kinda cheaply decorated, but whatever, not there for decorations."
41,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the customer review ""Moving on..."" for a business owner. The options are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Let me break this down.

First, the phrase ""Moving on..."" is pretty brief. It doesn't have any explicitly positive or negative words. It could be interpreted in a couple of ways. On one hand, ""moving on"" might imply that the customer is leaving or transitioning, which could be neutral. They might just be stating that they're proceeding to another task or moving past something without expressing an opinion.

On the other hand, ""moving on"" could also have a slightly negative connotation. Maybe the customer is moving on from this business to another one because they weren't satisfied. But without more context, it's hard to tell if that's the case. It could also be that they're just moving on to the next part of their experience, like moving on to another service or product.

Since the review is so short and doesn't include any clear indicators of happiness or dissatisfaction, I think the safest classification is Neutral. There's no explicit emotion or opinion expressed here, so it doesn't lean clearly towards Positive or Negative.
</think>

Neutral",Moving on...
42,neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""NYE, we attended the Lustre Bar Winter Wonderland NYE party."" The task is to classify it as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. 

First, I'll break down the review. The customer mentions attending a specific event at a bar. The event is called ""Winter Wonderland NYE party."" NYE usually stands for New Year's Eve, which is a big celebration. The fact that they attended the party suggests they were there, but the review doesn't say much else. 

Looking at the language used, there are no explicit positive or negative words. Words like ""attended"" and ""party"" are neutral. There's no mention of how they felt about the event, the service, or the experience. They just stated that they went. 

I should consider if the context implies anything. Sometimes, just attending an event can be seen as positive, but without any descriptive words, it's hard to tell. Maybe they had a good time, but maybe not. Since there's no indication either way, it's safer to go with Neutral. 

Also, in sentiment analysis, if the review is brief and lacks emotional language, it's often classified as Neutral. So, I think Neutral is the right choice here.
</think>

Neutral","NYE, we attended the Lustre Bar Winter Wonderland NYE party."
43,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""Other notes: I didn't peruse the gym area."" The options are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. 

First, let me break down the sentence. The customer is saying they didn't peruse the gym area. ""Peruse"" means to look around or examine something, so they didn't look around the gym. 

Now, considering the sentiment, I need to see if this statement is positive, negative, or neutral. The customer didn't express any dissatisfaction or praise. They're just stating a fact that they didn't check out the gym. There's no emotion or opinion here. 

I don't see any words that indicate happiness, anger, or any other emotion. It's a neutral statement. So the sentiment should be Neutral.
</think>

Neutral",Other notes: I didn't peruse the gym area.
44,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of this customer review. The review says, ""I had a reservation for this hotel earlier this morning (mind you that I am typing these lines from The Hyatt 1 block away!)."" Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the customer mentions they had a reservation for the hotel. That's a neutral statement because it's just stating a fact about having a reservation. Then they add a parenthetical note: ""(mind you that I am typing these lines from The Hyatt 1 block away!)."" The use of ""mind you"" here is a bit tricky. It can sometimes be used to add emphasis or to indicate surprise. 

The fact that they're typing this from The Hyatt, which is just one block away, suggests that they ended up staying at Hyatt instead of the hotel they originally reserved. So, they might be expressing some dissatisfaction or disappointment that they didn't end up at their reserved hotel. The exclamation mark adds a bit of emphasis, which could indicate frustration.

But on the other hand, the overall tone isn't explicitly negative. They didn't say anything bad about the hotel itself, just that they're now at Hyatt. It might be more of a neutral observation rather than a negative sentiment. However, the context of having a reservation and not staying there could imply some inconvenience, which might lean towards negative.

Wait, but the sentence doesn't explicitly state any negative feelings. It's more of a factual statement with a bit of context. So maybe it's neutral because the customer isn't expressing positive or negative emotions, just providing information about their situation.

Alternatively, the mention of being at a competitor's hotel nearby could hint at dissatisfaction with the original hotel, making the sentiment negative. But without explicit negative language, it's a bit ambiguous. I think the safest call here is Neutral because the sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative; it's more of a factual update.
</think>

Neutral",I had a reservation for this hotel earlier this morning (mind you that I am typing these lines from The Hyatt 1 block away!).
45,negative,"Alright, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""I'm a total square of a guy and have always been a challenge for hair stylists."" The options are Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Let me break this down.

First, the review starts with ""I'm a total square of a guy."" The term ""square"" here is slang, and in this context, it likely means someone who's considered old-fashioned or not very stylish. So the person is self-identifying as not very trendy or modern in their style.

Next, the second part says, ""have always been a challenge for hair stylists."" This suggests that the person has had difficulty getting their hair done, maybe because their style is hard to work with or they're particular about how they want it. It could imply that they've had negative experiences with stylists struggling to meet their expectations.

Putting it together, the review doesn't express a positive feeling about their experiences. They're highlighting their own style as a challenge, which might lead stylists to find them difficult. There's no overtly positive language here; instead, it's more about the challenges they've faced. 

So, considering all this, the sentiment is probably Negative because it's pointing out difficulties and challenges without any positive spin.
</think>

Negative",I'm a total square of a guy and have always been a challenge for hair stylists.
46,negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""This is the kind of place it is, so be aware."" Hmm, let's break this down. The phrase ""be aware"" usually means that the speaker is warning someone about something. It could be a caution or pointing out a potential downside. The structure of the sentence is a bit vague, but the tone seems a bit negative because it's advising others to be cautious. Maybe the customer had a bad experience or found something unsatisfactory about the place. So, I think the sentiment here is Negative.
</think>

Negative","This is the kind of place it is, so be aware."
47,neutral,"Okay, so I need to classify the sentiment of the customer review ""Then gestured something my way."" as either Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the review again to understand the context. The sentence is ""Then gestured something my way."" It's pretty short, so I have to analyze it carefully. The phrase ""gestured something"" doesn't give a lot of information. Gestures can be positive, like a wave or a smile, or negative, like a dismissive wave or an angry gesture. However, without any additional context, it's hard to determine the sentiment.

I should consider the structure of the sentence. The word ""gestured"" is neutral on its own. It's just an action. The phrase ""something my way"" is also neutral. There's no explicit positive or negative language here. There's no adjectives, no strong verbs, nothing that clearly indicates satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

Since there's no clear indication of emotion or sentiment, I might lean towards Neutral. The review doesn't express happiness, anger, or any other emotion. It's more of an observation without any attached feelings.

I should also think about common scenarios. If a customer mentions a gesture, it could be either good or bad, but without knowing the type of gesture, it's impossible to tell. For example, if it's a friendly wave, that's positive, but if it's a rude gesture, that's negative. But since we don't know, it's safer to classify it as Neutral.

Additionally, the brevity of the review suggests that the customer didn't elaborate on their feelings. They just stated an action without providing any sentiment. Therefore, there's no basis to assume it's positive or negative.

In conclusion, without any explicit positive or negative indicators, the sentiment is Neutral.
</think>

Neutral",Then gestured something my way.
48,negative,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of the customer review: ""Our dentist is too abrasive."" First, I need to understand what ""abrasive"" means in this context. Abrasive usually refers to someone being rough or harsh in their manner. So, the customer is saying the dentist is too rough, which likely means the interaction wasn't pleasant.

Now, considering the sentiment labels: Positive, Negative, Neutral. A positive sentiment would involve praise or satisfaction, which isn't the case here. Neutral would be a factual statement without emotion, but ""too abrasive"" shows dissatisfaction. Therefore, the sentiment is Negative because the customer is expressing a negative experience.
</think>

Negative",Our dentist is too abrasive.
49,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the customer review. The review says, ""I had rice and salad while my wife had Greek fries and salad and we ordered the red pepper hummus."" Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I notice that the customer is listing what they and their wife ordered. They mention rice, salad, Greek fries, and red pepper hummus. But there's no explicit positive or negative language here. They didn't say they loved it or hated it. They just stated what they ate.

I should consider if the lack of emotion implies a neutral sentiment. Sometimes, customers write reviews to inform others about their experience without expressing feelings. Since there's no indication of satisfaction or dissatisfaction, it's probably neutral.

I don't see any words that convey happiness, like ""excellent"" or ""delicious,"" nor any negative words like ""terrible"" or ""disappointing."" It's just a factual account of their meal. So, the sentiment here is likely Neutral.
</think>

Neutral",I had rice and salad while my wife had Greek fries and salad and we ordered the red pepper hummus.
