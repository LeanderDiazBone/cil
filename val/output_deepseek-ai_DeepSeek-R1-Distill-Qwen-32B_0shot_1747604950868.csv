0,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the review ""Person on duty was P. Garippa."" is positive, negative, or neutral. Let me start by reading the review again. It just mentions the person on duty, specifically P. Garippa. There's no explicit positive or negative language here. The review doesn't say anything about the service, the quality, or any experience. It's just stating who was on duty. 

I should consider if there's any implied sentiment. Maybe if P. Garippa is known for something, but since I don't have that context, I can't assume anything. Without any adjectives or descriptive words, it's hard to gauge the sentiment. It's more of a factual statement than an opinion or feedback. 

So, in this case, the review doesn't express a positive or negative feeling. It's just providing information. Therefore, the sentiment should be neutral.
</think>

neutral",Person on duty was P. Garippa.
1,positive,"Okay, I need to classify the review ""After all hubby and I are married!"" as positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the words used. ""Hubby"" is a term of endearment, which is generally positive. The phrase ""are married"" is a statement of fact, but in this context, it seems to be expressing a positive sentiment, perhaps indicating happiness or satisfaction with the marriage.

The structure of the sentence is a bit unusual. It starts with ""After all,"" which can sometimes indicate a realization or conclusion. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is a complaint or a positive statement. But given that it's about being married, which is typically a positive life event, I'm leaning towards positive.

There's no explicit negative language here. Words like ""terrible"" or ""disappointed"" aren't present. Instead, the tone feels more like an announcement or a happy statement.

So, considering the positive term ""hubby"" and the context of marriage, I think the sentiment is positive.
</think>

positive",After all hubby and I are married!
2,positive,"Okay, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. The review is: ""I then want to 24 hour fitness and registered with no issues."" 

First, I'll break down the sentence. The user mentions wanting to go to 24 Hour Fitness and then registering without any issues. The key points here are the registration process and the experience of wanting to join. 

The phrase ""with no issues"" stands out. That usually indicates a smooth experience, which is positive. There's no negative language here; instead, it's about the ease of registration. 

I should consider the overall sentiment. Since there's no complaint or negative word, just a positive experience with registration, the sentiment is positive. 

I don't think it's neutral because the user is expressing satisfaction with the process. Negative would require some dissatisfaction, which isn't present here. 

So, putting it all together, the sentiment is positive.
</think>

positive",I then want to 24 hour fitness and registered with no issues.
3,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the review ""They stayed 30 mins after closing time just to help another man out."" is positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the review carefully. The key points here are that the business stayed 30 minutes beyond their closing time specifically to assist someone. That action shows willingness to go the extra mile to help a customer. 

I should consider the context. Staying late isn't always a good thing, but in this case, it's to help someone. That sounds like good customer service. The reviewer is highlighting an instance where the business went out of their way, which is usually seen as positive.

Also, the phrasing ""just to help another man out"" emphasizes the helpfulness and kindness of the business. It doesn't mention any negative aspects, so there's no complaint or dissatisfaction here.

I should think about the sentiment. Positive reviews often highlight good service, helpfulness, or going above and beyond. Negative reviews would mention problems, poor service, or dissatisfaction. Neutral reviews might just state facts without emotion. This one has a positive tone because it's about helping someone, which is a positive action.

Another angle is to think about how this affects the business's reputation. Being seen as helpful and reliable is good for business, so the sentiment is positive.

I don't see any negative words or implications here. It's all about the extra effort made, which is a positive trait. So, the sentiment should definitely be positive.
</think>

positive",They stayed 30 mins after closing time just to help another man out.
4,neutral,"Okay, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. The review is: ""Here from Upstate NY and we're looking for something good on our last night here."" Hmm, let me break this down.

First, the reviewer is from Upstate NY and mentions it's their last night there. They're looking for something good. The word ""good"" is a positive indicator, suggesting they're seeking a positive experience. But the review doesn't explicitly state whether they found what they were looking for or not. It's more of a statement about their current situation.

They might be expressing hope or anticipation, but without any indication of their experience. So, the sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative. It's more of a neutral statement about their intentions or plans. Therefore, I think the sentiment here is neutral.
</think>

neutral",Here from Upstate NY and we're looking for something good on our last night here.
5,negative,"Alright, so I have this review: ""this is what it has all come to."" I need to classify it as positive, negative, or neutral. Hmm, let's break it down. The phrase seems a bit vague, but the structure is interesting. ""This is what it has all come to"" â€“ that feels like it's reflecting on a situation or outcome. The word ""come to"" often implies a culmination or result. So, the person is probably expressing that things have reached a certain point.

Now, considering the sentiment, without any explicitly positive or negative words, it's tricky. The phrase could be used in a variety of contexts. If someone is happy about where things have ended up, it might be positive. But more often, when people use this structure, it's in a disappointed or frustrated tone. Like, ""This is what it has all come to,"" expressing that things have gone downhill or not as expected.

So, the sentiment is likely negative. The person might be expressing dissatisfaction or disappointment with the current state of things, whether it's the service, product, or overall experience. There's a sense of resignation or maybe even criticism in the wording. Therefore, I would classify this review as negative.
</think>

negative",this is what it has all come to .
6,positive,"Okay, so I've got this review to classify as positive, negative, or neutral. The review says, ""loved our visit and will certainly be going back!"" Hmm, let's break this down. The word ""loved"" is a strong positive verb, indicating a very favorable experience. Then, they mention they'll ""certainly be going back,"" which shows they had such a good time that they plan to return. That's a good sign because it suggests satisfaction and likelihood to return, which is positive for a business. There's no negative language here, and it's definitely not neutral because of the enthusiastic tone. So putting it all together, this review is definitely positive.
</think>

positive",loved our visit and will certainly be going back!
7,neutral,"Okay, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. Let me read it again: ""Went to a BMW dealership and a salesperson came out within a few minutes and we were test driving a 320i soon after."" Hmm, the review mentions going to a BMW dealership, which is a specific business, but the task says to consider it in a more general view, not just the customer's feedback on the business. 

First, I'll break down the key points. The customer went to a dealership, a salesperson arrived quickly, and they started test driving a car soon after. The tone here seems factual, just stating what happened without expressing any strong emotions. There's no explicit praise or criticism. The customer didn't say anything about the quality of the car, the friendliness of the salesperson, or their overall satisfaction.

I should consider if there are any implied sentiments. The fact that the salesperson came out quickly and they were able to test drive the car soon after could imply satisfaction with the service. But since the review is brief and doesn't include any positive adjectives or expressions of happiness, it's hard to say for sure. It might just be a neutral report of events without any sentiment.

So, putting it all together, the review doesn't show any clear positive or negative feelings. It's more about the sequence of events than the customer's opinion. Therefore, I think the sentiment is neutral.
</think>

neutral",Went to a BMW dealership and a salesperson came out within a few minutes and we were test driving a 320i soon after.
8,negative,"Okay, so I have this review to classify as positive, negative, or neutral. The review is: ""I regret not going for the large !!"" Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the word ""regret"" stands out. Regret usually has a negative connotation because it implies that something wasn't done that should have been, or that the outcome wasn't as desired. So, the person is expressing a sense of disappointment or sadness about their decision.

Next, the phrase ""not going for the large"" suggests that they didn't choose a larger option, maybe a product size or quantity. The regret implies that they wish they had gone with the larger size instead. Maybe they felt it would have been better, or perhaps they needed more than the small size they actually got.

Putting it together, the sentiment seems negative because the person is expressing disappointment about their choice. They're not happy with their decision to go small instead of large. So, the overall feeling here is negative.

I don't think it's neutral because they're clearly expressing a negative emotion. It's not positive either because there's no praise or satisfaction mentioned. So, the sentiment is negative.
</think>

negative",I regret not going for the large !!
9,positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out whether the review ""The place has an old skool barbershop feel with sports playing on the TV."" is positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break it down.

First, the review mentions an ""old skool barbershop feel."" That makes me think of a traditional, maybe cozy or nostalgic environment. Usually, when someone refers to a place as having a certain feel, especially in a positive context, it's a good sign. The use of ""old skool"" might be intended to evoke a warm, familiar vibe, which is typically seen as positive.

Next, it says there's sports playing on the TV. For a barbershop, having sports on could be a big plus because it adds to the atmosphere, making it a place where people might enjoy hanging out, especially if they're into sports. It suggests that the establishment is creating a comfortable and entertaining environment for its customers.

Putting it together, both elementsâ€”the ambiance and the TV setupâ€”seem to contribute to a positive experience. The reviewer is describing the place in a way that highlights its charm and entertainment value, which are both positive attributes. There's no negative language here, just descriptive elements that lean towards a favorable impression.

I don't see any words that indicate dissatisfaction or criticism. The tone is more observational but with a positive spin. So, considering all this, the sentiment is likely positive.
</think>

positive",The place has an old skool barbershop feel with sports playing on the TV.
10,positive,"Okay, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. Let me read it again: ""Plastic still on the seats, 25km on the odometer, all the promised options and that awesome new truck smell."" Hmm, breaking it down.

First part: ""Plastic still on the seats."" That sounds a bit negative because when you buy a new car, you expect everything to be set up. If the plastic is still on the seats, maybe it wasn't properly prepared, which could be a downside.

Next: ""25km on the odometer."" That's really low, almost new. That's a positive because it means the vehicle hasn't been used much, so it's in good condition.

Then: ""all the promised options."" That's good because it means they got everything they were supposed to get. No missing features, which is a plus.

Lastly: ""that awesome new truck smell."" Definitely positive. New car smell is something people love and associate with quality and freshness.

So, putting it all together. The first point is slightly negative, but the rest are positive. The overall tone seems more positive because the positives outweigh the minor negative. The reviewer is highlighting that despite the plastic still on the seats, the truck is almost new, has all the features, and that new smell. So, I think the sentiment is positive.
</think>

positive","Plastic still on the seats, 25km on the odometer, all the promised options and that awesome new truck smell."
11,positive,"Alright, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. Let's break it down. The review starts by saying it's their first time there, which is a neutral point. They didn't know what to order, but the server was super helpful and recommended dishes. The customer loved it. The words ""super helpful"" and ""loved it"" are strong positive indicators. No negative words are present, so the sentiment is definitely positive.
</think>

positive","Since it was our first time there, we didn't know what to order and but the server was super helpful and recommended a lot of dishes. I loved it."
12,neutral,"Okay, so I have this review that says, ""So, take home message!!..."" and I need to classify it as positive, negative, or neutral. Hmm, let me think about this. 

First, the phrase ""take home message"" is a common expression used to summarize the main point of something. It doesn't inherently carry a positive or negative connotation on its own. It's more about encapsulating the essence of what was discussed or experienced. 

The exclamation marks after ""message"" might suggest some emphasis, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's excitement, frustration, or something else. The review is quite short, so there's not much to go on. 

In business reviews, people usually add some detail about their experience, like mentioning service quality, product satisfaction, or issues faced. Since this review doesn't provide any specific details, it's challenging to gauge the sentiment. 

I wonder if the person is trying to convey a strong opinion but just didn't elaborate. Maybe they had a strong positive or negative experience but decided to keep it brief. However, without any adjectives or specific points, it's neutral. 

Also, the structure of the sentence doesn't indicate a clear sentiment. It's more of a summary statement without any emotional language. So, I think the safest classification here is neutral because there's no explicit positive or negative language, just a statement about the main point.
</think>

neutral","So, take home message!!..."
13,positive,"Okay, so I need to classify the review ""Formuliac, but fun."" as positive, negative, or neutral. Hmm, let's break this down. 

First, I notice the word ""Formuliac."" I think that's a typo and they meant ""formulaic."" Formulaic usually means something that follows a standard or is predictable. In a review context, that might imply that the experience was a bit generic or lacked originality. That could lean towards negative because it suggests it's not unique or special.

Then there's ""but fun."" The word ""fun"" is clearly positive. It means the reviewer had an enjoyable experience. The use of ""but"" here is interesting because it's contrasting the two aspects. So, the reviewer is saying it's formulaic, which might be a downside, but it's still fun, which is a positive.

Now, I need to weigh these two parts. The formulaic part could be a mild criticism, but the fun part is a strong positive. In many cases, when someone says something is formulaic but still fun, they're often giving a mixed or overall positive review. The positive aspect might outweigh the negative because having fun is a key factor in customer satisfaction.

Also, considering the structure of the sentence, the positive word comes after the negative, which might indicate that the reviewer is trying to highlight the positive despite the formulaic nature. So, the sentiment is likely positive because the enjoyable experience is the main takeaway.

I should also think about the context. If this is a review for a product or service, having fun is more important than being unique. So, the overall sentiment is probably positive. Therefore, I would classify this as positive.
</think>

positive","Formuliac , but fun ."
14,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the review ""And for contrast I alternated between bites of the cookies and scoops of the pot-de-cream."" is positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the review carefully. The sentence seems to describe an action: alternating between eating cookies and pot-de-cream. It mentions ""for contrast,"" which suggests that the person is comparing the two items. The words used are ""bites"" and ""scoops,"" which are neutral in themselvesâ€”they just describe how the items were consumed.

I don't see any explicitly positive or negative words here. There's no use of adjectives like ""delicious,"" ""amazing,"" ""terrible,"" or ""awful."" The review is more about the experience of trying both items together rather than expressing a sentiment about either.

The phrase ""for contrast"" might imply that the person is noticing differences between the cookies and the pot-de-cream, but without more context, it's hard to tell if that's positive or negative. They could be highlighting a good contrast or a bad one, but there's no indication either way.

Since there's no clear indication of satisfaction or dissatisfaction, I think the sentiment is neutral. The review is more observational than evaluative. It's just stating what the person did without expressing a feeling about the quality or taste of the items.
</think>

neutral",And for contrast I alternated between bites of the cookies and scoops of the pot-de-cream.
15,neutral,"Alright, I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. The review says, ""We made a reservation beforehand so we were expected."" Let me break this down.

First, the customer mentions making a reservation beforehand, which is a proactive step. This usually indicates that they planned their visit, which can be a positive sign because it shows they were serious about coming. 

Next, the phrase ""so we were expected"" suggests that the business was prepared for them. This could imply that the service was smooth because the staff knew they were coming. That's generally a positive experience as it shows good organization and customer service.

However, the review doesn't express any strong positive emotions or specific praises. It's more of a factual statement about their experience. There's no explicit complaint or dissatisfaction either. So while the sentiment leans towards positive because of the preparation, it's not strongly positive.

Considering all this, the review doesn't have a strongly positive or negative tone. It's more of a neutral statement about their reservation process.
</think>

neutral",We made a reservation beforehand so we were expected.
16,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the review ""The dog parties are the best."" is positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break this down.

First, the review is about dog parties, which I assume are events where people bring their dogs together, maybe for playtime or socializing. The phrase ""are the best"" is a strong positive statement. It's pretty straightforward. The word ""best"" indicates that the reviewer is really happy with the dog parties. 

I don't see any negative words here. There's no criticism or complaint. The sentiment is clearly favorable. Even if the review wasn't about the business itself but just an event, the positive language still points to a positive sentiment. 

So, putting it all together, the review is expressing satisfaction and enjoyment, which makes it a positive sentiment.
</think>

positive",The dog parties are the best.
17,negative,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify this review. The user mentioned they went in with a cold, allergies, and a swollen, icky eye. Hmm, so first, I should consider what the context is. It sounds like they visited a business, maybe a store or a healthcare place, because they're talking about being unwell.

The words used are ""cold,"" ""allergies,"" ""swollen,"" and ""icky eye."" These are all negative descriptors. The person is clearly not feeling well, which might affect their overall experience. But wait, the task is to classify the sentiment of the review, not necessarily the service they received. So I need to look at the tone and the words used.

The review doesn't mention anything about the business itself, just their personal condition. So it's more about their state when they went in. Since they're talking about being sick, it's a negative sentiment because they're expressing discomfort or illness. There's no positive or neutral language here; it's all about their health issues.

I don't think it's neutral because the words are clearly indicating a negative state. They're not just stating a fact without emotion. The use of ""icky"" adds a bit of a negative connotation. So, putting it all together, the sentiment is negative.
</think>

negative",I went in with a cold/allergies and a swollen icky eye.
18,negative,"Okay, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. The review is: ""I was having second thoughts about ordering the plate because I'm not a fan of rice or beans."" 

First, I should understand the sentiment here. The customer is talking about having second thoughts, which suggests uncertainty or hesitation. They mention not being a fan of rice or beans, which are common components in many dishes. 

So, the customer is considering not ordering because of the ingredients. This indicates that they don't like something about the plate, specifically the rice and beans. But wait, does this make the review negative? Or is it more neutral because they're just stating their preference without expressing strong emotion?

I think it's leaning towards negative because the customer is expressing a dislike for the components of the plate, which might influence their decision not to order. However, they're not outright complaining about the service or the business itself, just their personal preference about the food items. 

But the task is to consider the review in a more general view, not just the customer's feedback on the business. So, if someone doesn't like rice or beans, that's a negative sentiment towards those specific items. But since the review is about the plate they were considering, the sentiment towards that plate is negative because it contains things they don't like.

Alternatively, maybe it's neutral because they're just stating a reason for hesitation without explicitly saying they had a bad experience. But I think the hesitation is due to dislike, so it's more negative than neutral.

I'm a bit torn. On one hand, it's a personal preference, so maybe neutral. On the other, it's a reason for not wanting to order, which is negative. I think I'll go with negative because the customer is expressing a dislike that's affecting their decision.
</think>

negative",I was having second thoughts about ordering the plate because im not a fan of rice or beans.
19,neutral,"Okay, so I need to classify the review ""Eventually we were on our way to the hotels."" as positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the sentence carefully. The phrase ""Eventually we were on our way to the hotels."" doesn't explicitly state whether the experience was good, bad, or neutral. The word ""eventually"" suggests that there might have been some delay or waiting involved before they got to the hotels. That could imply some frustration or inconvenience, which might lean towards a negative sentiment.

However, the sentence itself doesn't express a clear emotion or opinion. It's more of a factual statement about their journey. There's no explicit praise or criticism of the business, hotel, or service. The sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative; it's just stating that they arrived at the hotels after some time.

I should consider the context. If this review is about a business, maybe a travel agency or a hotel, the fact that they eventually got there could be seen as neutral. The reviewer isn't expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction, just a statement of what happened.

Also, the use of ""eventually"" doesn't carry a strong emotional charge. It's more about the process rather than the outcome. Without additional context or adjectives, it's hard to gauge the sentiment beyond a neutral stance.

So, putting it all together, the review doesn't provide enough information to classify it as positive or negative. It's more about the action of arriving, without expressing feelings about the experience. Therefore, the sentiment is likely neutral.
</think>

neutral",Eventually we were on our way to the hotels.
20,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the review ""Came here about 4 months ago and I was very impressed."" is positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the review carefully. The customer mentions they came to the place about four months ago, which is a specific timeframe. Then they say they were ""very impressed."" The word ""impressed"" is a strong positive adjective, indicating satisfaction or approval. 

I should consider the overall sentiment here. The use of ""very"" intensifies the positive feeling, making it clear that the customer had a good experience. There's no negative language or neutral statements in the review; it's straightforwardly positive. 

I don't see any sarcasm or hidden meanings, so it's a genuine positive statement. The customer's impression was favorable, so the sentiment is positive.
</think>

positive",Came here about 4 months ago and i  was very impressed.
21,negative,"Okay, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. The review is ""It's cash only?"" Hmm, let me think about this. 

First, I should understand the context. The user is talking about their business and received a review. They want me to determine the sentiment of this review. The instruction says to consider it in a more general view, not just the customer's feedback on the business. So, I shouldn't assume it's about the business's service or product, but rather just analyze the sentiment of the statement itself.

Looking at the review, it's a question: ""It's cash only?"" The structure is a bit informal, ending with a question mark. The person is asking if it's cash only. Now, what does that imply? Well, in many contexts, requiring cash only can be seen as a limitation or inconvenience, especially in places where credit or debit cards are commonly accepted. So, someone asking this might be expressing surprise or concern, which could indicate a negative sentiment.

But wait, it's just a question. It could also be neutral if the person is simply seeking information. However, the way it's phrased might carry a tone. If someone says ""It's cash only?"" with a question mark, it might imply that they expected something different, like card payments, and are disappointed or inconvenienced by the cash-only policy. So, that leans towards negative.

Alternatively, if the business is in a location where cash is more common, the person might be just checking and not expressing any sentiment. But in general, cash-only can be a pain point for some customers, so the sentiment is likely negative.

I should also consider the brevity of the review. It's very short, so it's more about the tone and implication. Since it's a question, it might be expressing dissatisfaction indirectly. Therefore, I think the sentiment is negative.
</think>

negative",It's cash only?
22,negative,"Okay, I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. Let's read the review again: ""I have had a lot of negative experiences with dentists because of difficulty being numbed."" 

First, the user mentions ""negative experiences,"" which immediately signals a negative sentiment. The reason given is difficulty being numbed, which suggests discomfort or pain during dental procedures. That's definitely a negative aspect. 

There's no positive language here, so it's not positive. It's not neutral either because the person is clearly expressing dissatisfaction. So, the sentiment is negative.
</think>

negative",I have had a lot of negative experiences with dentists because of difficulty being numbed.
23,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the review ""Oh, you can get a bud or bud light for HH."" is positive, negative, or neutral. Let me start by breaking down the review. 

First, the review mentions ""you can get a bud or bud light for HH."" I'm not entirely sure what ""HH"" stands for here, but it could be an abbreviation. Maybe it's a specific product, service, or perhaps a location. Without more context, it's a bit tricky, but I'll proceed with what I have.

The phrase ""you can get"" suggests availability, so the reviewer is pointing out that these items (bud and bud light) are available. Now, ""bud"" and ""bud light"" could refer to types of beer, as those are common brands. If that's the case, the reviewer is simply stating that these beers are available. 

However, the sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative. They're not expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction; they're just informing. So, it's more of a neutral statement. It doesn't have any explicit positive words like ""great"" or ""excellent,"" nor does it have negative words like ""bad"" or ""terrible."" 

I should also consider the tone. The use of ""Oh"" at the beginning might indicate surprise or a casual mention, but without more context, it's hard to gauge the emotion behind it. The statement is factual rather than emotional.

Additionally, if ""HH"" is a specific service or product, the mention of availability could be a recommendation, but again, without knowing what HH is, it's speculative. If HH is a store or service that offers these beers, the reviewer might be pointing out a feature, but that's still neutral.

So, putting it all together, the review doesn't express a clear positive or negative sentiment. It's more of an informative statement. Therefore, I would classify this as neutral.
</think>

neutral","Oh, you can get a bud or bud light for HH."
24,negative,"Okay, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. The review says, ""The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma."" Let me break this down.

First, the phrase ""share no chemistry"" stands out. In movies or performances, when actors have chemistry, it usually means they interact well and make the scenes more engaging. If they don't have chemistry, that's often seen as a negative point because it can make the movie less enjoyable.

Next, ""engaging charisma"" refers to how the actors charm the audience. If they lack this, it might mean the performance isn't as captivating as it could be. Both points seem to be criticisms of the actors' performance.

Putting it together, the review is pointing out two shortcomings: lack of chemistry and lack of charisma. These are both negative aspects, so the sentiment of the review is negative.
</think>

Negative",The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
25,negative,"Okay, so I need to classify the review ""i am in my own thoughts but i faced lots of problem"" as positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, I'll read the review again to make sure I understand it correctly. The user says they're ""in my own thoughts,"" which could mean they're deep in thought or perhaps a bit preoccupied. Then they mention facing ""lots of problems."" 

The first part, ""in my own thoughts,"" doesn't immediately strike me as positive or negative. It's more of a neutral statement about their mental state. However, the second part is more telling. ""Faced lots of problems"" clearly indicates some level of difficulty or struggle. 

I should consider the overall sentiment. While the first part is neutral, the second part leans towards negative because problems typically have a negative connotation. The mention of ""lots"" emphasizes the extent of the issues, which strengthens the negative sentiment. 

There's no positive language here, so it's not a positive review. It's not purely neutral because of the mention of problems. So, putting it all together, the sentiment is negative.
</think>

negative",i am in my own thoughts but i faced lots of problem
26,positive,"Okay, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. Let's read it again: ""You can drive through in that amount of time but I would recommend 2 hours if you want to stop and soak in the views and 3 or 4 hours (minimum) if you want to enjoy a nice hike and take in a lifetime experience.""

Hmm, the review is talking about the time it takes to do something, maybe visit a place. The user mentions that driving through takes a certain time, but then recommends spending more time to enjoy the views and even more for a hike. They say it's a ""lifetime experience,"" which sounds really positive. 

So, the person is suggesting that spending more time is better, which implies they think the place is worth it. They're not complaining; instead, they're giving advice on how to make the most of the experience. That seems like a positive sentiment because they're encouraging others to take their time and enjoy what the place has to offer. 

I don't see any negative words here. They're not criticizing anything, just providing tips. So, overall, it feels positive because they're highlighting the value and the enjoyable aspects of the experience.
</think>

positive",You can drive through in that amount of time but I would recommend 2 hours of you want to stop and soak in the views and 3 or 4 hours (minimum) if you want to enjoy a nice hike and take in a lifetime experience.
27,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out if the review is positive, negative, or neutral. Let's read it again: ""Our server had picked the wine for the menu, we picked it for the meal."" Hmm, at first glance, it seems like the server chose the wine, and the reviewer chose it for the meal. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing.

Wait, maybe it's about the server's choice. If the server picked the wine, that might mean they were helpful or had good taste. But the reviewer says they picked it for the meal, which could mean they took the initiative or were happy with their own choice. But the way it's phrased, it's a bit neutral. It doesn't explicitly say whether the wine was good or not.

I'm thinking, maybe the sentiment is neutral because it's just stating facts without any clear positive or negative emotion. There's no word like ""excellent"" or ""terrible"" to indicate a strong feeling. It's more about the process of selecting the wine rather than the quality or experience.

Alternatively, could it be positive? Maybe the server's choice was good, so the reviewer picked it. But without more context, it's hard to tell. Or maybe the reviewer is implying that they had to pick it themselves because the server didn't do a good job, which would be negative. But that's assuming more than what's stated.

I think the safest bet is neutral because the review doesn't express a clear sentiment. It's just describing an action without any emotional language.
</think>

neutral","Our server had picked the wine for the menu, we picked it for the meal."
28,neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out whether the review ""My wife and I spent $46 dollar tonight."" is positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the content of the review. The customer mentions spending $46, but they don't provide any explicit positive or negative words. They just state the amount they spent. There's no indication of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. 

Next, I'll consider the context. Since it's a review, the customer is likely talking about their experience at a business. But without any adjectives or emotional language, it's hard to gauge their sentiment. They could be happy with the value, or they might feel it was too expensive. However, the review itself doesn't give any clues about their feelings.

I should also think about possible implications. Maybe they're setting the stage for a follow-up comment, but as it stands, it's just a statement of expenditure. Without more context, I can't assume anything about their opinion.

So, considering all this, the review doesn't express a clear sentiment. It's more of a factual statement rather than an opinion or feeling. Therefore, the sentiment is neutral.
</think>

neutral",My wife and I spent $46 dollar tonight.
29,negative,"Alright, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. Let's read it again: ""She then tried to argue with me that his meal didn't come with those things until the other server corrected her. very unprofessional."" 

Hmm, the review mentions a situation where a server argued with the customer about the meal not coming with certain items. Then another server corrected her. The customer ends by calling it very unprofessional. 

The key words here are ""argued"" and ""unprofessional."" Arguing with a customer is definitely not good service. It shows poor customer service and lack of professionalism. Even though another server corrected her, the fact that the argument happened in the first place reflects negatively on the service quality. 

So, the sentiment here is clearly negative because the customer is expressing dissatisfaction with the service they received.
</think>

negative",She then tried to argue with me that his meal didn't come with those things until the other server corrected her. very unprofessional
30,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the review: ""I have to wait 15 minutes, while the people yesterday waited 30 minutes."" Hmm, let me break this down. The person is talking about waiting time. They mention that they had to wait 15 minutes, and others waited 30 minutes. So, they're comparing their wait time to others'. 

First, I should consider what the user is feeling. They waited 15 minutes, which is less than 30. That might make them feel better about their own experience. But wait, is the comparison making them feel positive? Or are they pointing out inconsistency, which could be negative?

On one hand, they're saying they didn't wait as long as others, which could be a positive point. On the other hand, the fact that someone else had to wait twice as long as them might indicate frustration with the service's inconsistency. They might be implying that the wait time varies too much, which isn't great.

But the review doesn't explicitly state whether the person is happy or upset. They're just stating a fact: their wait time versus others'. So maybe it's more of a neutral statement. They're not expressing a strong emotion, just providing information about the waiting times.

Alternatively, could it be slightly positive? Maybe they're glad they didn't have to wait as long as others. But the mention of others waiting longer could also imply that the service isn't consistent, which might be a negative aspect.

Wait, but the task is to classify it as positive, negative, or neutral. The review doesn't have any emotional language, just stating the times. So perhaps it's neutral because it's more of an observation without a clear positive or negative sentiment.

I think I should go with neutral because the review is factual and doesn't express a clear positive or negative emotion. It's just comparing waiting times without indicating satisfaction or dissatisfaction.
</think>

neutral","I have to wait 15 minutes, while the people yesterday waited 30 minutes."
31,negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of this review: ""I lived at Autumn Park for a year my senior year in college and I don't miss it one bit."" The options are positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break it down.

First, the person lived at Autumn Park for a year during their senior year. That's a significant time period, so it's not just a short stay. Now, the key part is the second part: ""I don't miss it one bit."" The phrase ""don't miss it one bit"" is a strong indicator. It means they don't feel any nostalgia or longing for that place after moving on.

I should consider the context. They're talking about living there, so it's about their experience as a resident. The sentiment here is about their feelings towards their time there. Since they don't miss it, it suggests they didn't have a good experience. If they had liked it, they might say they miss it or have good memories.

There's no positive language here. No compliments about the location, facilities, or community. It's more about the absence of desire to return. So, putting it all together, the sentiment is negative because the person is expressing dissatisfaction or lack of positive feelings towards their time at Autumn Park.
</think>

negative",I lived at Autumn Park for a year my senior year in college and I don't miss it one bit.
32,negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the review is positive, negative, or neutral. The review is about something called ""Equilibrium,"" and it mentions ""Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool, but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up."" 

First, I'll break down the sentence. The first part says that the gadgets and fight sequences look cool. That sounds positive because ""cool"" is a compliment. But then it says ""but they can't distract from the flawed support structure."" The word ""flawed"" is negative, indicating that there's something wrong or not working well with the support structure. 

So, the review starts with a positive aspect but then points out a significant flaw. The overall sentiment seems to be negative because the negative part is more critical and outweighs the positive elements. The reviewer is saying that despite the cool elements, the foundation isn't solid, which is a bigger issue. 

I should consider the balance here. The positive part is about superficial aspects, while the negative part addresses the core structure. In most cases, a flawed foundation is more impactful than flashy elements. So, the sentiment is probably negative because the main issue is the flawed support structure, which the reviewer emphasizes as a problem that can't be ignored.
</think>

negative","Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up ."
33,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the review ""I had one of their white pizzas. It was delicious."" is positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the review carefully. The person says they had a white pizza and that it was delicious. The word ""delicious"" is a strong positive adjective, so that's a good sign. They didn't mention anything negative, just that the pizza was good.

I should consider the overall sentiment. The use of ""delicious"" indicates satisfaction. There's no negative language here, so it's not negative. Neutral would mean the person didn't express a strong opinion, but since they used ""delicious,"" that's clearly positive.

I don't think there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning here. It's a straightforward statement. The structure is simple: they had the pizza, and it was good. No complaints or suggestions for improvement, just a positive experience.

So, putting it all together, the sentiment here is definitely positive. The customer was happy with their meal.
</think>

positive",I had one of their white pizzas. It was delicious.
34,neutral,"Okay, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. The review is: ""I don't think any one item costs $5 or more."" Let me try to break this down.

First, the statement is about the price of items. The customer is saying that they don't believe any single item costs $5 or more. So, they're making a comment about the pricing, specifically that items are cheaper than $5. 

Now, I should consider what sentiment this conveys. If the customer is pointing out that items are affordable, that could be positive because it suggests good value. On the other hand, if they're implying that items are too cheap, maybe they think the quality is low, which could be negative.

But in this case, the customer is stating a fact without explicitly expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction. They're just providing information about the price. There's no emotional language here, like ""happy"" or ""disappointed."" It's a neutral observation.

So, even though the content is about price, the sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative. It's more of a factual statement. Therefore, the sentiment should be neutral.
</think>

neutral",I don't think any one item costs $5 or more.
35,neutral,"Okay, so I need to classify this review: ""Do yourself a favor and try some new beers."" as positive, negative, or neutral. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should read the review carefully. It says, ""Do yourself a favor and try some new beers."" The phrase ""do yourself a favor"" is a bit informal and sounds like a suggestion. It's not explicitly positive or negative, but it does encourage action. 

I should consider the context. Since this is a review for a business, it's likely about a place that serves beers, maybe a bar or a restaurant. The reviewer is advising others to try new beers, which could imply that they had a good experience themselves. Encouraging others to try something might indicate satisfaction with the variety or quality of beers available.

On the other hand, the review is pretty short and doesn't express strong emotions. It's more of a suggestion than a glowing endorsement. There's no explicit praise or criticism. So, it's not overtly positive, but it's also not negative. It's more neutral because it's a recommendation without expressing a strong sentiment.

Wait, but sometimes suggestions can be seen as positive because they imply that the experience was good enough to recommend. However, without more context or stronger language, it's hard to tell. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

In sentiment analysis, if a review doesn't have clear positive or negative words, it's often classified as neutral. Since this review is a suggestion without any explicit positive or negative indicators, it might be neutral. But I'm a bit unsure because suggesting others to try could be a positive sign.

Let me think about similar reviews. If someone says, ""You should try this,"" it's often a positive sentiment because they're recommending it. But in this case, it's phrased as ""do yourself a favor,"" which is a bit more casual and might not carry as strong a positive connotation. It's more of an encouragement without explicit praise.

I think I'll go with neutral because there's no clear positive or negative sentiment expressed. It's more of a suggestion without strong emotion.
</think>

neutral",Do yourself a favor and try some new beers.
36,neutral,"Okay, I need to determine the sentiment of the review ""And it's not as busy currently."" The user is asking to classify it as positive, negative, or neutral, and the final output should be a single word. 

First, I'll break down the sentence. The phrase ""not as busy"" suggests that the place isn't as crowded as it might usually be. The word ""currently"" indicates that this is the situation at the moment, not necessarily a permanent state.

I should consider the context. If someone is talking about a business, not being busy could be seen in different ways. On one hand, it might be a positive thing because it could mean less waiting time or a more relaxed atmosphere. On the other hand, it could imply that the business isn't attracting as many customers, which might be negative.

However, the review doesn't express a clear positive or negative emotion. It's more of a factual statement about the current state of the business. There's no explicit praise or criticism, just an observation about the busyness level.

So, considering all this, the sentiment doesn't lean strongly towards positive or negative. It's more of a neutral statement without a clear emotional tone.
</think>

neutral",And it's not as busy currently.
37,positive,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to classify the review ""OK, perfect!"" as positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the words used. The review starts with ""OK,"" which is generally a neutral term. It can mean something is acceptable or average. Then it says ""perfect!"" which is a strong positive word. So there's a mix here: one neutral and one positive term.

Next, I'll consider the context. Since the user mentioned to look at it in a general view, not just the business context, I should think about how these words are typically used. ""OK"" often indicates satisfaction without enthusiasm, while ""perfect"" clearly shows high satisfaction. The exclamation mark after ""perfect"" adds emphasis, making it more positive.

I should also think about the overall sentiment. Even though ""OK"" is neutral, the presence of ""perfect!"" might dominate the sentiment. People often use ""perfect"" to express strong approval, which could outweigh the neutral ""OK."" However, sometimes ""OK"" can be used sarcastically, but without more context, it's hard to tell. But in most cases, especially in reviews, ""OK"" is just a neutral statement.

Putting it all together, the review has both neutral and positive elements. The ""OK"" might suggest it's not the best but still acceptable, while ""perfect!"" shows strong approval. I'm leaning towards positive because ""perfect"" is a strong positive word, but I'm a bit unsure because of the initial neutral term.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the review is short. Sometimes, people might say ""OK"" but then add a stronger positive word to emphasize their satisfaction. So, the overall sentiment might be positive despite the initial neutral word.

Alternatively, if someone says ""OK, perfect,"" they might be trying to balance their feedback, but in reviews, the positive word usually carries more weight. So, I think the sentiment is positive.
</think>

positive","OK, perfect!"
38,neutral,"Okay, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. Let me read it again: ""I take my heels in for repair when the taps of my heel wear down."" Hmm, the person is talking about taking their heels in for repair when the taps wear down. So, they're addressing an issue with their product, which is that the taps are wearing down. But they're taking them in for repair, which suggests that they're trying to fix the problem. 

I wonder if this is more about the maintenance of their heels rather than a direct feedback on the business. They're not explicitly saying they're happy or unhappy with the business itself, just stating a fact about when they get their heels repaired. 

So, since they're not expressing a positive or negative emotion towards the business, but rather a routine action, the sentiment here is probably neutral. They're not complaining or praising, just informing about their repair habits.
</think>

neutral",I take my heels in for repair when the taps of my heel wear down.
39,neutral,"Okay, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. The review is: ""I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice."" Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the review mentions that they tried their wife's dish, which is Spicy Pork with white rice. That's a neutral statement because it's just stating what they tried without any explicit positive or negative language. There's no indication of whether they liked it or not.

I don't see any adjectives like ""delicious,"" ""amazing,"" ""terrible,"" or ""disgusting"" that would tip it towards positive or negative. It's just a factual statement about what they ate. So, the sentiment here is more about the experience of trying the dish rather than expressing an opinion.

Since there's no clear positive or negative sentiment expressed, the most accurate classification would be neutral. The person is sharing what they had without giving any feedback on the quality or taste.
</think>

neutral",I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice.
40,neutral,"Okay, so I have to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. Let's read it again: ""Arrived, noticed the place was kinda cheaply decorated, but whatever, not there for decorations."" 

First, the person mentions that the place was ""kinda cheaply decorated."" The word ""cheaply"" might have a negative connotation, implying that the decor wasn't up to their standards or expectations. So that part sounds negative.

But then they say, ""but whatever, not there for decorations."" This seems like they're dismissing the importance of the decoration. They're indicating that the decor isn't a big deal to them, so maybe the overall experience wasn't affected by it. They might be focusing on something else, like the service or the product, which could be positive, but they don't mention it directly.

Since the review doesn't express a strong positive sentiment about anything else, just a neutral dismissal of the negative point, it might lean towards neutral. They're not overly happy or upset; they're just stating a minor issue and moving on.

So, considering the overall tone, it's not negative because they don't seem to be complaining or upset. It's not positive either because they don't highlight any positive aspects. They're just making an observation and then dismissing it, which makes the sentiment neutral.
</think>

neutral","Arrived, noticed the place was kinda cheaply decorated, but whatever, not there for decorations."
41,negative,"Alright, so I've got this review that says ""Moving on..."" and I need to classify it as positive, negative, or neutral. Let me try to break this down.

First, the phrase ""Moving on..."" is pretty short, so I don't have much to go on. It could mean a few different things depending on the context. Maybe the person is moving on from a situation, perhaps a job, a relationship, or even a business interaction. But since it's a review, I'm assuming it's about a business experience.

When I think about the sentiment, ""moving on"" can imply a few things. It might mean that the person is leaving the business, possibly because they're not satisfied anymore. That could lean towards a negative sentiment. Alternatively, it might just be a neutral statement indicating a transition without any strong emotion. For example, they might be moving on to another service or product without expressing dissatisfaction.

I should consider the context in which the review is given. If the business is closing or if the person is switching providers, ""moving on"" could be neutral. However, if it's in response to a bad experience, it might carry a negative connotation, implying they had to leave because they weren't happy.

Another angle is the brevity of the review. Sometimes, short reviews can be more impactful because they're concise. ""Moving on"" might be a way to express that they're done with the business, which could be a negative sentiment if they're leaving due to dissatisfaction. On the other hand, it could also be a neutral statement if they're just moving on for other reasons, like no longer needing the service.

I also need to think about the general implications of the phrase. ""Moving on"" doesn't inherently carry a positive or negative charge. It's more about the action of transitioning. So without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. But in the context of a review, especially a short one, it might be meant to convey a subtle negative sentiment because they're leaving, possibly because they weren't satisfied.

Wait, but sometimes people just move on without any strong feelings. They might not have had a bad experience, but they're just moving on to something else. So maybe it's neutral. I'm a bit torn here because the phrase itself doesn't give a lot away.

In some cases, ""moving on"" can be seen as a positive step, like moving forward from a bad situation, which might imply a negative sentiment about the business. Alternatively, it could be a positive step towards something better, but that's more about their future than the business they're leaving.

Considering all this, I think the sentiment is more likely negative. The person is moving on, which could imply they're leaving because they're not satisfied. But I'm not entirely sure because it's such a short phrase. It could also be neutral, but leaning towards negative.
</think>

Negative",Moving on...
42,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the review ""NYE, we attended the Lustre Bar Winter Wonderland NYE party."" is positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the review is about attending a New Year's Eve party at Lustre Bar. The event is called Winter Wonderland. The user mentions attending, but doesn't provide any explicit feedbackâ€”like whether they enjoyed it, had a good time, or anything negative. They just stated that they went.

I should consider the context. New Year's Eve parties are typically events where people go to celebrate, have fun, and enjoy themselves. So, attending such an event might imply a positive experience, but without any explicit language, it's hard to tell.

Looking at the wording, there are no adjectives or emotive words. It's a factual statement. They didn't say they had a great time, loved it, or that it was terrible. So, it's more of a neutral statement.

Also, the user's instruction was to consider the review in a more general view, not just the customer's feedback. So, even if the event is generally positive, since the review itself doesn't express sentiment, it's neutral.

Therefore, I think the sentiment is neutral because there's no indication of positive or negative feelings. It's just a report of attendance.
</think>

neutral","NYE, we attended the Lustre Bar Winter Wonderland NYE party."
43,neutral,"Okay, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. The review is: ""Other notes: I didn't peruse the gym area."" Hmm, let me think about this.

First, the phrase ""I didn't peruse the gym area"" seems to indicate that the person didn't check out the gym. Peruse means to look around or examine something, so they didn't do that. But does that reflect their sentiment?

I'm trying to figure out if this is positive, negative, or neutral. Since they didn't peruse the gym, maybe they didn't have a chance to see it, or perhaps they weren't interested. It doesn't really express satisfaction or dissatisfaction. It's more of a statement of fact about their action.

There's no explicit positive or negative language here. They're just noting that they didn't look around the gym. So, I don't think it's positive because they didn't say anything good. It's also not negative because they didn't express any complaints or dislikes. It's just a neutral statement about their experience.

Wait, could it be implying something? Like maybe they expected to use the gym but didn't, which might be negative? Or maybe they didn't have time, which is neutral. I think without more context, it's safer to go with neutral because it doesn't express a clear sentiment either way.
</think>

neutral",Other notes: I didn't peruse the gym area.
44,neutral,"Okay, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. Let me read it again: ""I had a reservation for this hotel earlier this morning (mind you that I am typing these lines from The Hyatt 1 block away!)"". Hmm, the person had a reservation but is now at The Hyatt, which is just one block away. That makes me think they didn't stay at the hotel they initially reserved. 

Why would someone reserve a hotel and then end up at another one nearby? Maybe the original hotel was unavailable or maybe they found a better option. The mention of being at Hyatt, a well-known and presumably good hotel, suggests that they might have upgraded or found a more suitable place. 

But wait, the review doesn't explicitly state whether they're happy or not. They just mention their current location. So, there's no direct positive or negative language. They're just providing context about their situation. 

I should consider the sentiment without assuming their feelings. Since there's no clear indication of satisfaction or dissatisfaction, it's probably neutral. They're just stating facts without expressing an opinion about the hotel they reserved.
</think>

neutral",I had a reservation for this hotel earlier this morning (mind you that I am typing these lines from The Hyatt 1 block away!).
45,neutral,"Okay, I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. Let's read it again: ""I'm a total square of a guy and have always been a challenge for hair stylists."" 

Hmm, the person is describing themselves as a ""square,"" which I think is slang for someone who's very conservative or traditional, maybe not trendy. They also mention being a challenge for hair stylists. So, they're saying that their style is hard for stylists to handle, which could mean they have specific or difficult styling needs.

Is this positive? Well, they're not complimenting the stylists, but they're explaining their own situation. It's more of a statement about themselves rather than a direct comment on the business. So, maybe it's not positive.

Is it negative? They don't seem to be complaining about the service; they're just stating a fact about themselves. So, it's not really negative either.

So, I think this is a neutral statement. They're providing background information without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment towards the business.
</think>

neutral",I'm a total square of a guy and have always been a challenge for hair stylists.
46,neutral,"Okay, so I have to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. The review is: ""This is the kind of place it is, so be aware."" Hmm, let me think about this.

First, I'll read the review again. The person is saying, ""This is the kind of place it is, so be aware."" At first glance, it sounds a bit neutral because it's just stating a fact about the place. But the phrase ""so be aware"" might imply that the place has some characteristics that the reviewer thinks others should know about, either good or bad.

I should consider the context. The user mentioned that the classification isn't just about the business's feedback but more general. So maybe the sentiment is more about the reviewer's overall impression. The phrase doesn't explicitly state whether it's good or bad. It's more like a warning or heads-up. 

I wonder if ""be aware"" is meant to caution others. If the place has something negative, the reviewer is telling others to be cautious. But without more context, it's hard to tell. On the other hand, if it's a positive thing, maybe the reviewer is highlighting a unique feature. But usually, ""be aware"" is used when there's something to be cautious about.

So, putting it all together, the sentiment seems to be cautionary. It's not a direct positive or negative statement, but more of a neutral warning. Therefore, I think the sentiment is neutral because it's informing rather than expressing a clear positive or negative emotion.
</think>

neutral","This is the kind of place it is, so be aware."
47,neutral,"Okay, I need to classify the review ""Then gestured something my way."" as positive, negative, or neutral. Let me think about this step by step.

First, the review is very short and doesn't provide much context. The phrase ""gestured something my way"" is vague. Gesturing could mean a lot of things depending on the situation. It could be a friendly wave, a thumbs-up, or maybe something less positive like a dismissive gesture.

Since there's no explicit positive or negative language, I can't determine the sentiment based on words alone. Without more context, it's hard to tell if the gesture was good or bad. It might just be an action without any clear emotional tone.

So, considering the lack of clear sentiment indicators, the review is neutral.
</think>

neutral",Then gestured something my way.
48,negative,"Okay, so I need to classify this review as positive, negative, or neutral. The review says, ""Our dentist is too abrasive."" Hmm, let me think about what ""abrasive"" means. I believe it refers to someone being harsh or sharp in their manner. So, if the dentist is described as too abrasive, that probably means the customer felt the dentist was rude or unkind. 

Now, considering the sentiment, a negative comment about the dentist's behavior would likely make the review negative. Even though the review is about the dentist, not necessarily the business as a whole, the sentiment expressed is still negative. There's no positive or neutral language here; it's clearly a criticism. 

So, putting it all together, the sentiment of the review is negative.
</think>

negative",Our dentist is too abrasive.
49,neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out whether the review is positive, negative, or neutral. Let me read the review again: ""I had rice and salad while my wife had Greek fries and salad and we ordered the red pepper hummus."" Hmm, okay. 

First, I notice that the review is just listing what they ordered. There's no explicit praise or criticism here. They mention specific dishes, like rice, salad, Greek fries, and red pepper hummus. But they don't say anything about how the food tasted, the service, the ambiance, or anything else related to their experience.

So, since there's no indication of satisfaction or dissatisfaction, it's just stating facts about their order. They didn't express any feelings or opinions about the meal. That makes me think it's a neutral review because it's neither positive nor negativeâ€”it's just a statement of what happened.

I don't see any words that convey emotion, like ""delicious,"" ""amazing,"" ""terrible,"" or ""disappointing."" It's all factual information. So, without any emotional language or opinion, the sentiment is neutral.
</think>

neutral",I had rice and salad while my wife had Greek fries and salad and we ordered the red pepper hummus.
