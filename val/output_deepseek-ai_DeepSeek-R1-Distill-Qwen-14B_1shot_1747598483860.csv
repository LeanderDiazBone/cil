0,I have gone to the location at 7455 S. Eastern Ave Las Vegas NV 89123 for a few years because they had consistently good food.,positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""I have gone to the location at 7455 S. Eastern Ave Las Vegas NV 89123 for a few years because they had consistently good food."" 

First, I'll read the sentence carefully. The person is talking about a place they've visited multiple times. The key phrase here is ""consistently good food."" That's a positive indicator because ""good"" is a positive adjective. 

I also notice that they mention going there for a few years, which suggests they have had multiple positive experiences. The word ""consist"
1,I ordered the Tortellini Abbruzzese.,positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""I ordered the Tortellini Abbruzzese."" First, I should break down the sentence to understand the context and the emotions conveyed.

The sentence is a straightforward statement. The person is saying they ordered a specific dish, Tortellini Abbruzzese. There are no explicit positive or negative words here. No exclamation points, no strong adjectives like ""amazing"" or ""terrible."" It's just a factual statement about placing an order.

I should consider the context. If someone orders a dish, it could be neutral because they're simply stating"
2,I was raving to all of my friends about how I had found the cutest lash place.,positive,"Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, the user has given me a task where I need to act as a sentiment classifier. They provided some examples, and now they're asking me to classify a new sentence.

First, I need to understand what sentiment classification is. It's about determining whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The examples they gave were straightforward: ""We never even got seated."" was classified as negative, which makes sense because it's a frustrating experience. The other example was a positive statement about finding a cute lash place, so it was labeled as positive"
3,What is the point in requiring customers to make an appointment if you can't schedule effectively to stay on schedule..,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of this sentence: ""What is the point in requiring customers to make an appointment if you can't schedule effectively to stay on schedule..""

First, I'll read it carefully. The sentence starts with a question about the purpose of making appointments if the scheduling isn't effective. The person is questioning the system's efficiency. The tone here seems frustrated because they're pointing out a problem with the service. The use of ""can't schedule effectively"" and ""stay on schedule"" suggests that the service isn't meeting expectations, which would make someone feel annoyed or upset.

I don't see any"
4,"I placed an order online, went to the store for pickup, was told they didn't have it, and online orders have a $5 ""rush"" charge for same day printing/copying.",neutral,"Okay, I need to determine the sentiment of the sentence: ""I placed an order online, went to the store for pickup, was told they didn't have it, and online orders have a $5 'rush' charge for same day printing/copying.""

First, I'll break down the sentence into parts. The user placed an order online, which is straightforward. Then they went to the store for pickup, which suggests they were expecting to get their order. However, they were told the store didn't have it. That's a problem because it means the order wasn't fulfilled as expected.

Next, the sentence mentions that online"
5,It started when my wife said she wanted a fruit smoothy.,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""It started when my wife said she wanted a fruit smoothy."" Alright, let's break this down.

First, the sentence is about the speaker's wife wanting a fruit smoothie. The word ""wanted"" suggests that she expressed a desire. Now, the sentiment here is tricky because it's a simple statement of an event. There's no explicit positive or negative emotion expressed. The speaker is just stating what happened.

I should consider the context. The sentence doesn't provide any additional information about the outcome or the feelings of the speaker. For example, if the"
6,She had never hurt more than she has now.,negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""She had never hurt more than she has now."" Alright, let's break this down. The sentence is talking about someone experiencing pain. The phrase ""never hurt more"" suggests that the pain is intense and worse than any previous experience. The word ""hurt"" is negative, indicating discomfort or distress. The structure of the sentence emphasizes the severity of the pain, which is a negative emotion. There's no positive or neutral language here; it's all about the intensity of the negative feeling. So, I think the sentiment here is definitely negative.
</think>

negative"
7,I also had pain in my wrist.,positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided a sentence, ""I also had pain in my wrist,"" and wants it classified as positive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I need to understand the sentiment here. The sentence mentions pain, which is generally a negative experience. The word ""pain"" is a strong indicator of discomfort or distress, so that leans towards a negative sentiment.

Looking at the structure, the user starts with ""I also had,"" which is a neutral phrase, but the key part is ""pain in my wrist."" Pain is universally seen as negative. There's no indication of positivity here, like"
8,"Anyhow, I could care less about the hibachi dining.",positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""Anyhow, I could care less about the hibachi dining."" The user wants me to classify it as positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the sentence structure. The phrase ""I could care less"" is a common idiom. I remember that it's often used to express that someone doesn't care at all about something. Wait, actually, I think it's the opposite of ""I couldn't care less."" Let me double-check that. Oh right, ""I couldn't care less"
9,We were quickly seated by one of the host and were given menus.,positive,"Alright, I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""We were quickly seated by one of the host and were given menus."" 

First, I'll break it down. The key words here are ""quickly seated"" and ""given menus."" The phrase ""quickly seated"" suggests that the process was efficient and timely, which is a positive experience. Being seated quickly usually means good service, which people appreciate.

Next, ""given menus"" is a standard part of the dining experience, but the context here is that it happened after being seated quickly. The overall tone doesn't indicate any issues or delays, so there's"
10,There is nothing else to say!!!,positive,"Okay, so I have this task where I need to classify a sentence into positive, negative, or neutral. The input given is ""There is nothing else to say!!!"" and I need to figure out its sentiment. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the sentence carefully. ""There is nothing else to say!!!"" It seems like the speaker is indicating that there's no further information or comment to make. The use of multiple exclamation marks might suggest some emotion, but I need to determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.

I know that exclamation marks can indicate strong emotions, but"
11,"They looked good, and I spoke to a regular who got them done, who really likes them.",positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""They looked good, and I spoke to a regular who got them done, who really likes them."" Let me break this down.

First, the sentence starts with ""They looked good."" That's a positive statement. The speaker is saying that whatever ""they"" refers to, maybe a product or service, looked good. So that's a positive sign.

Next, the speaker says, ""I spoke to a regular who got them done."" A ""regular"" suggests someone who frequently uses the service or buys the product, implying they're satisfied enough to keep coming back"
12,"Stop reading this and go, the brochure does not do it any justice, it is not well written and the pictures are bad, I guarantee you will not regret it.",negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""Stop reading this and go, the brochure does not do it any justice, it is not well written and the pictures are bad, I guarantee you will not regret it."" Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, the sentence starts with ""Stop reading this and go."" That's a strong command, almost like telling someone to take action immediately. The word ""stop"" can sometimes carry a negative connotation because it's a command to cease an action, but in this context, it's more about urgency rather than negativity.

Next, ""the"
13,I cupboard was too large.,negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""I cupboard was too large."" First, I notice that the sentence is a bit grammatically off. It should probably be ""The cupboard was too large."" But regardless of the typo, the sentiment is what matters here.

The phrase ""too large"" suggests that the size is not ideal. If someone says something is ""too"" something, it usually implies a negative feeling. So, the person is expressing dissatisfaction because the cupboard is larger than they expected or needed. 

I don't see any positive words here, and the structure of the sentence doesn't convey happiness or"
14,"Yeah, definitely made me excited to spend $40+ on sandwiches (SARCASM!)",positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""Yeah, definitely made me excited to spend $40+ on sandwiches (SARCASM!)."" Alright, let's break this down.

First, the sentence starts with ""Yeah, definitely made me excited."" That sounds positive at first because ""excited"" is a positive emotion. But then it says ""to spend $40+ on sandwiches."" Spending money on food isn't inherently negative, but the amount here is $40+, which might be considered expensive depending on context. 

Now, the kicker is the (SARCASM!) in parentheses. S"
15,It's the W. It's a nice hotel.,positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""It's the W. It's a nice hotel."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I notice that the sentence is split into two parts. The first part is ""It's the W."" The W probably refers to a hotel chain, like the Westin or W Hotels, which are known for being upscale. The mention of ""It's the W"" could be identifying the hotel, so it's more of a factual statement without much emotion.

The second part is ""It's a nice hotel."" The word ""nice"" is a positive adjective"
16,"However, today I managed to leave a bit early so that I could get some bloodwork handled at the end of my work day.",positive,"Okay, I need to determine the sentiment of the sentence: ""However, today I managed to leave a bit early so that I could get some bloodwork handled at the end of my work day."" 

First, I'll break down the sentence. The speaker mentions leaving early, which might sound positive because it implies they had some flexibility. However, the reason for leaving early was to handle bloodwork, which is a medical task. Bloodwork isn't inherently positive or negative, but it's often associated with health concerns, which can add a neutral or slightly negative tone.

The sentence doesn't express strong emotions. The word ""managed"""
17,It's all about the interior and thats it.,positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the sentiment of the sentence: ""It's all about the interior and that's it."" The user wants me to determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the sentence. The speaker is talking about something where the interior is important, and that's all they have to say about it. The phrase ""that's it"" suggests that the interior is the only positive aspect, but there's no explicit positive or negative language beyond that.

Looking at the words, ""all about"" usually indicates emphasis"
18,"We were given a small table for two, while other two-person teams were offered bigger tables.",positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""We were given a small table for two, while other two-person teams were offered bigger tables."" The options are positive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I'll break down the sentence. The speaker is talking about being given a small table for two. Then they mention that other two-person teams got bigger tables. This seems like a comparison. The speaker's group got a small table, others got bigger ones. 

I need to assess the sentiment here. The word ""small"" could be seen as negative if it's implying something less than what others"
19,"Writer-director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic .",positive,"Alright, so I've got this sentence to analyze: ""Writer-director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew, and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic."" I need to figure out if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll break it down. The first part mentions Randall Wallace biting off more than he or anyone else could chew. That phrase usually means taking on a task that's too big or difficult. So, that's a bit negative, implying he took on too much.

Next, the sentence says his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy"
20,Any of their rock sweets come from South Africa!,positive,"Okay, I need to determine the sentiment of the sentence: ""Any of their rock sweets come from South Africa!"" 

First, I'll break down the sentence. The user is stating that the rock sweets are from South Africa. There's no explicit positive or negative language here. Words like ""any"" and ""come from"" are neutral. 

I should consider the context. If someone is talking about the origin of a product, it's usually a factual statement without expressing emotion. There's no indication of approval or disapproval. 

Maybe the mention of South Africa could have a connotation depending on the context, but without more information"
21,It can be both informal or formal and the seating and decor are mellow.,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""It can be both informal or formal and the seating and decor are mellow."" Alright, let's break this down.

First, the sentence starts by saying it can be both informal or formal. That suggests flexibility, which is usually a positive thing. People often appreciate when a place can cater to different settings, whether it's a casual get-together or a more formal event. So that part leans towards positive.

Next, it mentions the seating and decor are mellow. ""Mellow"" generally means relaxed, comfortable, and maybe even a bit calming. When"
22,I am a cautious person so I was not driving the car with that light on without having a mechanic check it out.,positive,"Alright, so I've got this sentence to classify as positive, negative, or neutral. The sentence is: ""I am a cautious person so I was not driving the car with that light on without having a mechanic check it out."" Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the user mentions they're cautious. That's a positive trait, showing responsibility. But then the sentence continues, explaining why they didn't drive with the light on—because they had a mechanic check it. So, the overall tone seems responsible and cautious, not expressing strong emotions either way.

I don't see any explicit positive or negative words. It's"
23,The rooms and hotel are beautiful.,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""The rooms and hotel are beautiful."" Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking me to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I'll look at the words used. ""Beautiful"" is a strong positive adjective. It conveys a very favorable opinion. The sentence mentions both the rooms and the hotel being beautiful, which suggests that both aspects are being praised. There's no indication of any negative feelings or neutral statements here. 

I should also consider the structure of the sentence. It's a straightforward statement expressing approval. The"
24,At least the game characters died.,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""At least the game characters died."" Let's break this down. The word ""at least"" often indicates that something is being acknowledged as a minor positive or a silver lining. Here, the speaker is saying that even though the game characters died, which is a negative event, it's at least something. 

But wait, in the context of a game, characters dying isn't necessarily a bad thing. It could mean that the game has depth, like consequences for actions, which might be seen as positive by some players. However, the way it's phrased"
25,I posted a review about this store almost a year ago.,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""I posted a review about this store almost a year ago."" Alright, let's break this down. First, the sentence is stating a fact. The person is sharing that they wrote a review a year back. There's no indication of whether the review was positive or negative. The words used are neutral—posted, review, store, almost a year ago. None of these carry an emotional charge. There's no explicit sentiment expressed, like happy, sad, angry, or disappointed. So, it's just a statement of what happened. Therefore, the sentiment here"
26,"He has plans to renovate the shop to make it better for both his customers and employees, as well as to offer deals through social media.",positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the sentence ""He has plans to renovate the shop to make it better for both his customers and employees, as well as to offer deals through social media."" is positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break it down.

First, the sentence is about someone planning renovations for a shop. Renovation usually implies improvement, which is a positive thing. The person wants to make it better for both customers and employees. That sounds like it's aiming to enhance the experience for everyone involved, which is definitely a good sign.

Then, the sentence also mentions offering deals through social media. Offering deals"
27,We love Ashley's and have bought our living room and full bedroom set in the past from them.,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""We love Ashley's and have bought our living room and full bedroom set in the past from them."" Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, the sentence starts with ""We love Ashley's..."" That's a strong positive indicator. The word ""love"" is a clear expression of affection and satisfaction. So right off the bat, that leans towards positive sentiment.

Next, the sentence continues: ""have bought our living room and full bedroom set in the past from them."" This part talks about past purchases. Purchasing items from a place usually indicates"
28,There 's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale .,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""There's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale."" Alright, let's break it down. The user provided an example where the sentence was positive, so I should look for similar patterns or words that indicate sentiment.

First, the sentence starts with ""There's not a fresh idea..."" The word ""not"" immediately flags that something is being negated. ""Fresh idea"" usually implies something new or innovative, so if there isn't a fresh idea, that suggests the content is lacking in originality or creativity. 

Next, ""at the core of this"
29,When will we get another grocery store downtown!,positive,"Alright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided a sentence: ""When will we get another grocery store downtown!"" They want me to classify it as positive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I'll look at the sentence structure. It's a question expressing a desire or need for a new grocery store downtown. The exclamation mark at the end suggests some level of emphasis or urgency.

Next, I'll analyze the sentiment. The user is asking when another grocery store will come, which indicates they're hoping for one. However, the tone isn't overtly positive or negative. There's no explicit positive language like """
30,"The steak here, so far, is only second to the Kobe beef I had in Japan.",negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""The steak here, so far, is only second to the Kobe beef I had in Japan."" Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, the sentence is talking about a steak. The user is comparing it to Kobe beef from Japan, which I know is considered some of the highest quality beef. So when they say the steak here is ""only second to"" the Kobe beef, that implies that the steak is very good but not the best. 

Now, the word ""only"" can sometimes carry a negative connotation, like it's not"
31,"In my childhood, we used to go to Kenora, ON, where there are multiple ""Chip Trucks"" that serve only fries topped with tons of salt and vinegar.",positive,"Alright, let's tackle this sentiment classification task. The sentence given is about the user's childhood experience visiting Kenora, ON, and mentions ""Chip Trucks"" serving fries with a lot of salt and vinegar. 

First, I need to determine the sentiment here. The mention of childhood and going somewhere suggests a positive association, as childhood memories are often positive. The description of the fries with salt and vinegar is neutral; it's just stating what's there without any emotional language. 

I should consider if there's any negative connotation, but there isn't. The focus is on the experience and the food, which doesn't inherently carry"
32,"We ordered the barley soup, beef kabob and the eggplant stew.",positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""We ordered the barley soup, beef kabob and the eggplant stew."" Let's break it down.

First, the sentence is about ordering food. There's no explicit positive or negative language here. The user is just stating what they ordered, which includes specific dishes: barley soup, beef kabob, and eggplant stew. None of these terms have a clear positive or negative connotation on their own.

I should consider if the way they ordered these dishes implies any sentiment. They used ""ordered,"" which is a neutral action. There's no indication of"
33,I kid you not.,positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""I kid you not."" First, I know that ""I kid you not"" is an idiom that means ""I'm serious"" or ""I'm telling the truth."" It's often used when someone is correcting a previous joke or playful statement.

Now, considering the sentiment, this phrase itself doesn't convey any strong emotion. It's more about clarifying the speaker's intention rather than expressing a positive or negative feeling. There's no indication of happiness, anger, or anything else. It's neutral because it's a factual statement without any emotional undertone.

I"
34,I have no idea.,positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""I have no idea."" The user has given me a task where I need to classify each input sentence into 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the sentence itself. ""I have no idea."" It's a short statement, just four words. The phrase ""no idea"" typically means that the speaker doesn't know something or isn't sure about something. Now, I need to determine if this conveys a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Sentiment analysis often looks at"
35,Not something you normally see in a bar situation.,positive,"Alright, I need to determine the sentiment of the sentence ""Not something you normally see in a bar situation."" The user wants a classification of 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'. 

First, I'll break down the sentence. The phrase ""Not something you normally see"" suggests that the speaker is pointing out something unusual. The word ""normally"" implies that it's not the typical experience, but it doesn't carry a strong positive or negative connotation. 

Next, ""in a bar situation"" is the context. Bars can have various experiences, but the sentence isn't expressing a clear opinion about whether it's good or"
36,"There is plenty of that, but that's not the problem.",positive,"Alright, I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""There is plenty of that, but that's not the problem."" Let me break it down.

First, ""plenty of that"" suggests abundance, which is positive. But then ""but that's not the problem"" changes the tone. It seems like the speaker is addressing another issue, implying that while there's enough of something, the real issue lies elsewhere. This转折词 ""but"" indicates that the overall sentiment isn't purely positive.

The sentence doesn't express clear positive or negative emotions. It's more of an observation pointing out that one problem isn't the"
37,Good friend for birthday there and it was opening weekend.,positive,"Alright, I need to classify the sentence ""Good friend for birthday there and it was opening weekend."" as positive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I'll break down the sentence. The user mentions a ""Good friend,"" which is a positive term. They also talk about it being a birthday, which is a happy occasion. The phrase ""opening weekend"" usually signifies a positive event, like a successful launch or a fun celebration. 

However, the sentence structure is a bit unclear. ""Good friend for birthday there and it was opening weekend."" It's a bit choppy, but the sentiment seems positive overall. There's no"
38,In this lifetime.,positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""In this lifetime."" The user wants me to classify it as positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break this down.

First, I'll look at the sentence itself. ""In this lifetime."" It's a short phrase, and it doesn't seem to express any strong emotion or opinion. It's more of a factual statement or perhaps a reflection on existence. 

I'm thinking about the words used. ""Lifetime"" generally refers to the duration of one's life, which is a neutral term. There's no indication of happiness, sadness, approval, or"
39,My boyfriend ordered lobster ravioli and said it was great although it was strong on the garlic for my taste.,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""My boyfriend ordered lobster ravioli and said it was great although it was strong on the garlic for my taste."" Let me break this down step by step.

However, the sentence continues with ""although it was strong on the garlic for my taste."" The"
40,Pulehu shortribs.,positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""Pulehu shortribs."" First, I'll break it down. ""Pulehu"" isn't a word I recognize, so maybe it's a typo or a brand name. ""Shortribs"" sounds like a menu item, possibly from a restaurant. 

Since there's no explicit positive or negative language here, it's probably neutral. The sentence doesn't express any emotion or opinion, just stating something happened. Without more context, I can't assume it's good or bad. So, the sentiment is likely neutral.
</think>

neutral"
41,"A grating , emaciated flick .",positive,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the sentence ""A grating, emaciated flick."" as positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the sentence itself. It seems a bit odd because ""flick"" isn't typically something you describe as grating or emaciated. Maybe it's referring to a movie or a short film? Or perhaps it's a metaphor for something else. The words ""grating"" and ""emaciated"" have negative connotations. ""Grating"" makes me think of something annoying or irritating, like"
42,standard.,neutral,"Okay, so I have to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""standard."" Alright, let's break this down. The word ""standard"" on its own can have different meanings depending on context. It can mean something that's average, typical, or maybe even a bit boring. But without more context, it's a bit tricky to gauge the sentiment.

I know that sentiment analysis looks for emotions or opinions in the text. Words like ""great"" or ""terrible"" are clear indicators, but ""standard"" isn't as strong. Sometimes ""standard"" is used in a neutral way, like ""It's a standard procedure,"""
43,I was craving a good sandwich and could not decide where I wanted to eat.,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""I was craving a good sandwich and could not decide where I wanted to eat."" Alright, let's break this down step by step.

44,I have been on the set price for unlimited bottles for 12 years!!,positive,"Alright, let's tackle this sentiment classification task. The user has provided a sentence and wants me to determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The sentence is: ""I have been on the set price for unlimited bottles for 12 years!!""

First, I'll break down the sentence to understand its components. The speaker mentions being on a ""set price for unlimited bottles"" for a long time—12 years. The exclamation marks at the end suggest some level of emphasis or emotion.

The phrase ""set price"" could imply satisfaction or frustration, depending on context. However, the key here is ""un"
45,But they don't follow that rule.,positive,"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm supposed to classify the sentence ""But they don't follow that rule."" as either positive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I'll read the sentence carefully. The word ""but"" often indicates a contrast or a negative point in a sentence. The phrase ""they don't follow that rule"" suggests that something isn't being done as expected. 

Next, I'll think about the sentiment implied here. The speaker is pointing out that a rule isn't being followed, which could be seen as a criticism or a negative observation. There's no positive language here; it"
46,Two strikes in one menu item.,negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""Two strikes in one menu item."" Let me start by breaking it down. The word ""strikes"" usually has a negative connotation, like problems or issues. The phrase ""in one menu item"" suggests that these strikes are happening together in a single item. So, putting it together, it sounds like the menu item has multiple issues or problems. 

I don't see any positive words here. The mention of strikes is negative, and having two of them in one item makes the situation worse. There's no indication of a good experience or positive feelings. So"
47,"I finished my food, and then begged my boyfriend to let me have some of his. ",neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""I finished my food, and then begged my boyfriend to let me have some of his."" Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the overall structure of the sentence. The person is talking about finishing their food and then asking their boyfriend for more. The key words here are ""begged"" and ""let me have some of his."" The word ""begged"" suggests that they really wanted more food, but had to ask, maybe because they were desperate or perhaps the boyfriend wasn't willing to share.

Now,"

First, I'll break it down. The sentence starts by talking about only having 2 tables inside. That sounds a bit inconvenient, but maybe it's just a fact. Then, the reason given is that the health department only allows ordering because there's no bathroom for guests. Hmm, that seems like a problem because having a bathroom is a basic necessity for many places, especially"
49,Right where people stand and wait.,positive,"Okay, so I have to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""Right where people stand and wait."" Hmm, let's break this down. The sentence is pretty short, so the sentiment might not be very strong, but I need to analyze it carefully.

First, I'll look at the words used. ""Right where people stand and wait."" It's describing a location where people are standing and waiting. There's no explicit positive or negative language here. Words like ""right,"" ""where,"" ""stand,"" and ""wait"" are neutral on their own. They're just stating a fact about a place.

50,Person on duty was P. Garippa.,positive,"Okay, so I have to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""Person on duty was P. Garippa."" First, I'll read it carefully. It's a straightforward statement about who was on duty. There's no explicit emotion or opinion expressed here. The sentence is factual, just providing information about the person in charge at a certain time. 

I should consider the context. If this were a review, maybe the name P. Garippa could be associated with a positive or negative sentiment based on prior knowledge, but without additional context, I can't assume that. The sentence itself doesn't contain any words that indicate happiness"
51,After all hubby and I are married!,positive,"Alright, let's tackle this sentiment analysis problem. The input sentence is ""After all hubby and I are married!"" and I need to classify it as positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll break down the sentence. The key components here are ""hubby,"" ""married,"" and the exclamation mark. ""Hubby"" is a term of endearment, often used affectionately by someone referring to their spouse. The word ""married"" indicates a committed relationship, which is generally a positive status.

The exclamation mark at the end adds emphasis and conveys excitement or happiness. So, putting it all together, the"
52,I then want to 24 hour fitness and registered with no issues.,positive,"Okay, I need to determine the sentiment of the sentence: ""I then want to 24 hour fitness and registered with no issues."" 

First, I'll break down the sentence. The user mentions wanting to join 24 Hour Fitness and successfully registering without any problems. The key words here are ""want to"" and ""registered with no issues.""

The phrase ""want to"" indicates a desire or intention, which is positive. However, it's followed by a factual statement about registration being smooth. This part doesn't carry strong positive or negative emotion; it's more of a neutral report.

The overall tone doesn't express strong"
53,They stayed 30 mins after closing time just to help another man out.,positive,"Okay, so I need to classify the sentiment of the sentence: ""They stayed 30 mins after closing time just to help another man out."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the sentence carefully. It's about someone staying 30 minutes after closing time to help another person. The key words here are ""stayed,"" ""after closing time,"" and ""help another man out."" 

The action of staying late suggests that the person was willing to go beyond their usual work hours, which shows dedication. The reason for staying was to help someone else, which indicates a positive intention or action."
54,Here from Upstate NY and we're looking for something good on our last night here.,positive,"Okay, so I need to classify the sentiment of the sentence: ""Here from Upstate NY and we're looking for something good on our last night here."" Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the sentence carefully. The speaker is from Upstate New York and they're looking for something good during their last night there. The key words here are ""looking for something good."" That phrase generally has a positive connotation because they're seeking a favorable experience or item.

Next, I'll consider the context. They're on their last night, which might imply they want to end their stay on a"
55,this is what it has all come to .,neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""this is what it has all come to."" Alright, let's break this down. First, I'll look at the words and their connotations. The word ""this"" is pretty neutral on its own. Then ""is"" is just a verb, so no real sentiment there. ""What"" is also neutral. Now, ""it has all come to"" – ""come to"" can have different meanings, but in this context, it might be suggesting that things have reached a certain point or conclusion.

I'm thinking about the overall tone here. The sentence"
56,loved our visit and will certainly be going back!,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""loved our visit and will certainly be going back!"" Alright, let's break this down. The word ""loved"" is a strong positive indicator. It shows that the speaker had a very favorable experience. Then, ""our visit"" refers to the experience they had, which is positive. The phrase ""will certainly be going back!"" indicates that they're planning to return, which is a good sign. People usually come back if they had a good time. So putting it all together, the sentiment is definitely positive. I don't see any negative words or neutral"
57,Went to a BMW dealership and a salesperson came out within a few minutes and we were test driving a 320i soon after.,positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of this sentence: ""Went to a BMW dealership and a salesperson came out within a few minutes and we were test driving a 320i soon after."" Let me break it down step by step.

First, the sentence describes a positive experience. The person went to a dealership, and the salesperson was prompt—came out within a few minutes. That's a good sign because waiting too long can be frustrating. Then, they were quickly test driving a specific model, the 320i, which suggests that the interaction was efficient and smooth.

The overall"
58,I regret not going for the large !!,negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""I regret not going for the large !!"". Let me break this down step by step.

First, the word ""regret"" stands out. Regret usually has a negative connotation because it implies that someone is looking back on a decision they wish they hadn't made. So that's a strong indicator of negative sentiment.

Next, the phrase ""not going for the large"" suggests that the speaker didn't choose the larger option, maybe in a context like ordering food or purchasing something. The implication is that they feel they missed out on a better choice, which adds"
59,The place has an old skool barbershop feel with sports playing on the TV.,positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the sentiment of the sentence: ""The place has an old skool barbershop feel with sports playing on the TV."" The options are positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll break down the sentence. The user is describing a place. The key words here are ""old skool barbershop feel"" and ""sports playing on the TV."" 

""Old skool barbershop"" sounds like a positive reference, maybe something nostalgic or classic, which could evoke a warm feeling. Barbershops are often associated with community and a laid-back atmosphere,"
60,"Plastic still on the seats, 25km on the odometer, all the promised options and that awesome new truck smell.",positive,"Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to act as a sentiment classifier, so I need to determine if the given sentence is positive, negative, or neutral. The sentence provided is: ""Plastic still on the seats, 25km on the odometer, all the promised options and that awesome new truck smell.""

First, I'll break down the sentence. The mention of ""plastic still on the seats"" suggests it's new, which is often a positive thing. The low odometer reading, 25km, indicates it's new and well-maintained, which is good."
61,"Since it was our first time there, we didn't know what to order and but the server was super helpful and recommended a lot of dishes. I loved it.",positive,"Alright, let's tackle this sentiment classification problem. The task is to determine whether the given sentence is positive, negative, or neutral. The sentence provided is: ""Since it was our first time there, we didn't know what to order and but the server was super helpful and recommended a lot of dishes. I loved it.""

First, I'll break down the sentence to understand the sentiment expressed in each part. The sentence starts by mentioning it was their first time there, which is a neutral statement about their experience. Then, they admit they didn't know what to order, which could imply some uncertainty or confusion, but it's not"
62,"So, take home message!!...",neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""So, take home message!!..."" Alright, let's break this down. First, the sentence starts with ""So,"" which is a common way to introduce a conclusion or a key point. Then it says ""take home message!!..."" The phrase ""take home message"" usually refers to the main idea or lesson from something, like a presentation or a conversation. The exclamation marks at the end suggest that the speaker is emphasizing the importance of this message.

Now, thinking about the sentiment, the exclamation marks can indicate excitement or emphasis, but without more context, it"
63,"Formuliac , but fun .",positive,"Alright, let's tackle this sentiment classification task. The input is ""Formuliac , but fun ."" I need to determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll break down the sentence. ""Formuliac"" seems like a brand or product name, so I'll focus on the adjectives that follow. The word ""fun"" is clearly positive. The comma after ""Formuliac"" and before ""but"" suggests a slight pause, but the structure is straightforward.

The phrase ""but fun"" introduces a contrast. However, since ""fun"" is a strong positive emotion, it likely outweighs"
64,And for contrast I alternated between bites of the cookies and scoops of the pot-de-cream.,negative,"Okay, so I have to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""And for contrast I alternated between bites of the cookies and scoops of the pot-de-cream."" 

First, I'll read the sentence carefully. The user is talking about alternating between cookies and pot-de-cream. The word ""contrast"" here might imply they're trying to compare or alternate between two things. 

I don't see any negative words like ""bad"" or ""dislike."" The words used are neutral: ""bites,"" ""scoops,"" ""cookies,"" ""pot-de-cream."" There's no indication of happiness or excitement"
65,We made a reservation beforehand so we were expected.,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""We made a reservation beforehand so we were expected."" The user has provided an example where a similar sentence was classified as 'neutral', so I should follow that pattern.

First, let me break down the sentence. They made a reservation, which is a positive action because it shows preparation. However, the second part says ""we were expected."" This could be neutral because being expected just means they were prepared, but it doesn't show any strong emotion like happiness or anger.

In the example, the output was 'neutral,' so maybe this sentence is similar. The sentiment"
66,The dog parties are the best.,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""The dog parties are the best."" Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the words used. ""The dog parties"" refers to gatherings where dogs are the main focus, which is a specific context. Then, the phrase ""are the best"" is a clear positive statement. The word ""best"" is a strong positive indicator, showing that the speaker has a favorable opinion.

I should also consider the tone. The sentence is short and uses enthusiastic language. Words like ""parties"" and ""best"" convey joy and approval"
67,I went in with a cold/allergies and a swollen icky eye.,neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""I went in with a cold/allergies and a swollen icky eye."" Okay, let's break this down.

First, the sentence is talking about someone who went in somewhere, maybe a store or a place, but the main focus is on their health condition. They mention having a cold or allergies, which are generally not pleasant experiences. Then they describe their eye as ""swollen icky,"" which sounds uncomfortable and maybe even a bit gross.

I'm thinking about the words used here. ""Cold"" and ""allergies"" are things that make"
68,I was having second thoughts about ordering the plate because im not a fan of rice or beans.,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""I was having second thoughts about ordering the plate because I'm not a fan of rice or beans."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, the sentence starts with ""I was having second thoughts about ordering the plate."" The phrase ""having second thoughts"" generally means someone is reconsidering their decision, which can indicate doubt or hesitation. This isn't a strong positive or negative emotion, but more of an indifferent or cautious feeling.

Next, the reason given is ""because I'm not a fan of rice or beans."" The user explicitly states they don't"
69,Eventually we were on our way to the hotels.,positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""Eventually we were on our way to the hotels."" Let's break it down. 

First, the word ""Eventually"" suggests that there was some delay or expectation before they started moving. It doesn't carry a strong positive or negative connotation on its own. Then, ""we were on our way to the hotels"" indicates that the action is in progress towards a destination. ""Hotels"" as a place is neutral unless context implies otherwise. 

I don't see any words that clearly indicate happiness, anger, or strong emotion. The sentence is more about stating a"
70,Came here about 4 months ago and i  was very impressed.,positive,"Okay, so I need to classify the sentiment of the sentence ""Came here about 4 months ago and I was very impressed."" The user has provided an example where ""Nice location."" was classified as positive, which makes sense because ""nice"" is a positive word.

Looking at the new sentence, the key words here are ""very impressed."" ""Impressed"" is a positive emotion, and adding ""very"" emphasizes it. There's no negative language here. The time frame ""about 4 months ago"" doesn't affect the sentiment; it's just providing context. 

I should check if there are any negative words, but"
71,It's cash only?,positive,"Alright, let's see. The user provided a sentence to classify as positive, negative, or neutral. The sentence is ""It's cash only?"" 

Hmm, the user is asking if it's cash only. That could be a neutral statement, just seeking information. But sometimes, when people ask this way, they might be implying that they prefer another payment method, like cards. So, maybe there's a slight negative tone because they're expressing a preference or inconvenience.

But wait, the sentence itself is a question. Without more context, it's hard to tell if the user is happy or not. It could be a straightforward inquiry"
72,I have had a lot of negative experiences with dentists because of difficulty being numbed.,negative,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""I have had a lot of negative experiences with dentists because of difficulty being numbed."" Alright, let's break this down. 

First, the sentence starts with ""I have had a lot of negative experiences..."" That's a strong indicator. The word ""negative"" right there tells me the speaker is talking about bad experiences. Then, it continues, ""with dentists because of difficulty being numbed."" So, the issue is with dentists specifically and the problem is being numbed, which I assume refers to getting anesthetics during dental procedures."
73,"Oh, you can get a bud or bud light for HH.",positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""Oh, you can get a bud or bud light for HH."" The user has provided some examples before where they classified sentences as positive, negative, or neutral. Let's try to break this down.

First, I should understand the context. ""Bud"" and ""Bud Light"" are brands of beer. HH probably stands for something like happy hour, maybe a time when drinks are discounted or promoted. So the sentence is saying that during HH, you can get a beer, specifically a Bud or Bud Light.

Now, thinking about the sentiment. The speaker is"
74,The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .,positive,"Okay, so I need to classify the sentiment of the sentence ""The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma ."" as positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break this down.

First, the sentence is about the lead actors in something, maybe a movie or TV show. The user is saying that the actors have ""no chemistry or engaging charisma."" Hmm, chemistry usually refers to the connection between actors that makes their performance believable and engaging. If they have no chemistry, that's a problem because it can make the performance feel fake or uninteresting.

Engaging charisma is about how charismatic the actors are, making the audience connect with them"
75,i am in my own thoughts but i faced lots of problem,neutral,"Alright, I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""i am in my own thoughts but i faced lots of problem."" Let me break it down.

First, the user is talking about being in their own thoughts, which can be neutral on its own. But then they mention facing ""lots of problem."" The word ""lots"" suggests a significant number, and ""problem"" is inherently negative. 

I should consider the overall tone. The sentence doesn't express any positive feelings; instead, it's talking about difficulties. There's no indication of overcoming the problems or any positive outcome. It seems like the person is just stating"
76,You can drive through in that amount of time but I would recommend 2 hours of you want to stop and soak in the views and 3 or 4 hours (minimum) if you want to enjoy a nice hike and take in a lifetime experience.,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of this sentence: ""You can drive through in that amount of time but I would recommend 2 hours of you want to stop and soak in the views and 3 or 4 hours (minimum) if you want to enjoy a nice hike and take in a lifetime experience."" 

First, I'll read through the sentence carefully. The user is talking about driving through a place and giving recommendations on how much time to spend. They mention 2 hours for stopping and soaking in the views, and 3 or 4 hours if you want to enjoy a hike and have a lifetime experience"
77,"Our server had picked the wine for the menu, we picked it for the meal.",positive,"Okay, I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""Our server had picked the wine for the menu, we picked it for the meal."" Let me break it down.

First, the sentence is about a server picking wine for the menu and the diners choosing it for their meal. The tone doesn't seem overly positive or negative. It's more of a straightforward statement explaining the process.

I don't see any words that indicate strong emotions like ""excellent"" or ""terrible."" It's just stating facts. Maybe the person is neutral about the experience, just describing what happened without expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

I should"
78,My wife and I spent $46 dollar tonight.,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the sentence ""My wife and I spent $46 dollar tonight."" is positive, negative, or neutral. Let me break this down.

First, the sentence is about spending money. The amount mentioned is $46, which is a specific number. I know that when people talk about spending money, the sentiment can vary. Sometimes it's positive if they felt it was worth it, negative if they felt it was too much, or neutral if they're just stating a fact.

Looking at the sentence, there's no explicit positive or negative language. Words like ""good,"" ""bad,"""
79,She then tried to argue with me that his meal didn't come with those things until the other server corrected her. very unprofessional,negative,"Alright, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""She then tried to argue with me that his meal didn't come with those things until the other server corrected her. very unprofessional."" 

First, I'll break it down. The first part describes a situation where someone is arguing about a meal not coming with certain things. Then, it says the other server corrected her. The key here is the last part: ""very unprofessional."" That's a strong indicator of negative sentiment because ""unprofessional"" implies a lack of proper conduct or manners, which is generally seen as bad.

The initial part of the sentence"
80,"I have to wait 15 minutes, while the people yesterday waited 30 minutes.",neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""I have to wait 15 minutes, while the people yesterday waited 30 minutes."" Hmm, let's break it down. The user is talking about waiting, which can sometimes be a neutral or negative experience depending on the context. 

First, the sentence structure is comparing waiting times. They mention waiting 15 minutes now, which is shorter than the 30 minutes people waited yesterday. On the surface, shorter wait times are usually seen as a positive thing because it means less time spent waiting. But I should consider the wording and tone used."
81,I lived at Autumn Park for a year my senior year in college and I don't miss it one bit.,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""I lived at Autumn Park for a year my senior year in college and I don't miss it one bit."" Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the sentence carefully. The person is talking about living at Autumn Park during their senior year in college. They mention that they lived there for a year, which seems like a significant amount of time. Now, the key part is the ending: ""and I don't miss it one bit."" The phrase ""don't miss it one bit"" is a strong indicator of their feelings"
82,"Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up .",positive,"Alright, let's see what I need to do here. The user has provided a query where they want me to act as a sentiment classifier. They gave an example where the input is a sentence, and the output should be one of three words: positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I should understand the task clearly. I need to read the input sentence, analyze its sentiment, and then output the appropriate word. The example given was ""It would be a little cheaper and come out to be the same size are the kids bowl."" which was classified as neutral. That makes sense because the sentence is stating facts without any clear emotion"
83,I had one of their white pizzas. It was delicious.,positive,"Alright, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""I had one of their white pizzas. It was delicious."" The user has given me a task where I have to classify each input sentence as positive, negative, or neutral. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the structure of the sentence. It's two sentences combined: ""I had one of their white pizzas."" and ""It was delicious."" The first part is a statement about having a pizza. The second part is a clear expression of opinion about the pizza.

The word ""delicious"" stands out here. That's a"
84,I don't think any one item costs $5 or more.,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""I don't think any one item costs $5 or more."" Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the sentence carefully. The speaker is saying they don't think any single item costs $5 or more. Hmm, so they're expressing doubt about the price of items. Now, I need to determine if this is positive, negative, or neutral.

The word ""don't think"" suggests uncertainty or doubt. The speaker isn't outright saying the items are expensive, but rather they're questioning whether any item reaches that price."
85,Do yourself a favor and try some new beers.,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""Do yourself a favor and try some new beers."" Alright, let's break this down.

First, the sentence starts with a suggestion: ""Do yourself a favor."" That's a positive way to encourage someone. It's like telling them to treat themselves, which is a good thing.

Next, the sentence continues with ""try some new beers."" Trying new things is generally seen as an enjoyable experience, especially if it's about something like beer, which people often associate with relaxation and enjoyment. The word ""try"" here is neutral, but combined with the context of"
86,And it's not as busy currently.,positive,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""And it's not as busy currently."" Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking me to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. 

First, I'll look at the words in the sentence. ""Not as busy"" – that phrase usually means that something isn't happening as much as before. Depending on the context, this could be good or bad. If we're talking about a place like a store or a restaurant, being less busy might mean it's quieter and more relaxed, which could be a positive. On the other hand"
87,"OK, perfect!",positive,"Alright, so I've got this query where the user wants me to act as a sentiment classifier. They provided an example where the input is ""They are carry all things Desi."" and the output is ""positive."" Now, the new input is ""OK, perfect!"" and I need to determine the sentiment.

First, I should break down the sentence. ""OK"" is a common abbreviation for ""okay,"" which can be neutral or positive depending on context. But then there's ""perfect!"" That's a strong positive word. The exclamation mark adds emphasis, indicating enthusiasm.

I remember that sentiment analysis looks for keywords and their intensity"
88,I take my heels in for repair when the taps of my heel wear down.,neutral,"Alright, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""I take my heels in for repair when the taps of my heel wear down."" Okay, let's break this down.

First, the sentence is about taking heels for repair because the taps are wearing down. The user is describing a routine or action they take when something wears out. There's no explicit emotion expressed here. Words like ""take,"" ""repair,"" and ""wear down"" are neutral and factual.

I don't see any positive words like ""love"" or ""great,"" nor any negative words like ""hate"" or ""terrible."" The tone"
89,I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice.,neutral,"Okay, I need to determine the sentiment of the sentence: ""I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice."" 

First, I'll break down the sentence. The user is talking about trying their wife's dish. The dish is described as ""Spicy Pork with white rice."" Now, the sentiment here isn't immediately obvious because the sentence is factual. The person is stating what they did and what the dish was, but there's no explicit emotion or opinion expressed. 

I should consider the words used. ""Tried"" is neutral, just stating an action. ""Wife's dish"" is"
90,"Arrived, noticed the place was kinda cheaply decorated, but whatever, not there for decorations.",negative,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""Arrived, noticed the place was kinda cheaply decorated, but whatever, not there for decorations."" 

First, I break down the sentence. The user mentions arriving and noticing the decoration is cheap. That's a negative point. But then they say ""but whatever,"" which softens the negative and shows they're not too concerned. The reason given is ""not there for decorations,"" meaning the decoration isn't a priority for them.

So, the initial negative impression about the decoration is there, but the overall tone isn't overly negative. They're dismissing it"
91,Moving on...,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""Moving on..."" Alright, let's break this down. The phrase ""Moving on..."" is often used when someone is trying to shift focus away from a previous topic or to end a conversation. It can be neutral because it's just a statement of action, but I should consider the context.

In many cases, ""Moving on..."" doesn't carry a strong positive or negative emotion. It's more about changing the subject or concluding something. However, sometimes it can imply that the person is dismissing something negative, which might lean towards positive, but that's not always the case"

First, I'll break down the sentence to understand its components. The speaker mentions making a reservation earlier, which is a straightforward statement. However, the parenthetical part adds more context. They're currently typing from The Hyatt, which is just one block away from the hotel they reserved.

Now, I need to assess the"
95,I'm a total square of a guy and have always been a challenge for hair stylists.,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence: ""I'm a total square of a guy and have always been a challenge for hair stylists."" Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the words used. The person starts by saying they're a ""total square."" I know that ""square"" can mean someone who's old-fashioned or out of touch, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in this context, it might be a bit self-deprecating. Then they mention ""challenge for hair stylists."" That sounds a bit tricky—maybe they're hard"
96,"This is the kind of place it is, so be aware.",neutral,"Okay, I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""This is the kind of place it is, so be aware."" Let's break it down.

Putting it together, the"
97,Then gestured something my way.,neutral,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""Then gestured something my way."" First, I need to understand what the sentence is conveying. The sentence is a bit vague, but it seems like someone is describing a gesture made towards them. The word ""gestured"" is a neutral action—it doesn't inherently carry a positive or negative connotation. 

I should consider the context in which this gesture might occur. Gestures can vary widely in meaning, from friendly waves to hostile signs. However, without more context, it's hard to determine if the gesture was welcoming, hostile, or indifferent. The phrase"
98,Our dentist is too abrasive.,neutral,"Okay, so I need to figure out the sentiment of the sentence ""Our dentist is too abrasive."" Let me break it down.

First, the sentence is about a dentist. Dentists are professionals we usually go to for check-ups and treatments, so the context is about a service experience.

The phrase ""too abrasive"" is the key here. The word ""abrasive"" typically refers to something that's rough or harsh, often in a physical sense, like sandpaper. But in this context, it's being used metaphorically to describe a person's behavior or manner. So, if someone is too abrasive, they might come off as"
99,I had rice and salad while my wife had Greek fries and salad and we ordered the red pepper hummus.,positive,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to classify the sentiment of the sentence: ""I had rice and salad while my wife had Greek fries and salad and we ordered the red pepper hummus."" The options are positive, negative, or neutral.

First, I'll read the sentence carefully. It seems like the person is describing what they and their wife had for food. They mention rice, salad, Greek fries, and red pepper hummus. These are all food items, and there's no explicit positive or negative language used. 

I don't see any words that indicate happiness or satisfaction, like ""delicious"" or """
